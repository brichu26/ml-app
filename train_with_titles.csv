"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: My son has been having some issues with speech and development. He's 13 years old now.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about his symptoms? Does he have any issues with muscle tone or hypotonia?
Patient: No, he doesn't have hypotonia. But he has mild to moderate speech and developmental delay, and he's been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We'll run some tests, including an MRI, to get a better understanding of your son's condition. 
(After the tests)
Doctor: The MRI results are in, and I'm glad to say that there are no structural brain anomalies. However, I did notice some physical characteristics. Does your son have any facial features like retrognathia, mild hypertelorism, or a slightly elongated philtrum and thin upper lip?
Patient: Yes, he has all of those features. His hands are also broad and short. And his feet have mild syndactyly of the second and third toe, with a sandal gap in both feet.
Doctor: Thank you for confirming that. We also conducted Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analyses, and we found a de novo frameshift variant in his genetic makeup. Specifically, it's Chr1(GRCh37):g.244217335del, NM_205768.2(ZBTB18):c.259del(p.(Leu87Cysfs*21)). This leads to a premature termination codon located more than 400 codons upstream of the canonical termination codon.
Patient: What does that mean for my son?
Doctor: This genetic variant may be contributing to your son's speech, developmental delay, and attention deficit disorder. It's important that we continue monitoring his progress and provide appropriate support for his development.
Patient: What should we do for follow-up?
Doctor: Regular visits with a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist can help address your son's developmental and attention deficit disorder needs. I will also recommend regular check-ups with me to monitor his growth and overall health.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. We will follow your recommendations and keep an eye on his progress.","S: The patient's mother reports that her 13-year-old son has mild to moderate speech and developmental delays and has been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. She denies any issues with muscle tone or hypotonia. The patient also exhibits certain physical characteristics, including retrognathia, mild hypertelorism, an elongated philtrum, thin upper lip, broad and short hands, mild syndactyly of the second and third toes, and a sandal gap in both feet.
O: An MRI of the brain showed no structural anomalies. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) revealed a de novo frameshift variant Chr1(GRCh37):g.244217335del, NM_205768.2(ZBTB18):c.259del(p.(Leu87Cysfs*21)), indicating a premature termination codon located more than 400 codons upstream of the canonical termination codon.
A: The primary diagnosis is a genetic disorder associated with the identified frameshift mutation, which likely contributes to the patient's speech and developmental delays and attention deficit disorder. The physical characteristics and genetic findings suggest a specific syndrome, which needs further correlation with clinical findings and genetic counseling.
P: The management plan includes regular follow-up visits with a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist to support the patient's developmental needs and address his attention deficit disorder. Regular medical check-ups will monitor his growth and overall health. Genetic counseling for the family is also recommended to discuss the implications of the genetic findings and potential familial inheritance.","Create a Medical SOAP note summary from the dialogue, following these guidelines:

"Doctor: Hello, what brings you in today?
Patient: Hi, my 21-month-old son has been experiencing weakness in his lower extremities and lumbar pain after a mild upper respiratory tract infection.
Doctor: I see. Did you consult any medical professional for this issue?
Patient: Yes, we took him to the pediatric emergency department. They did a hip ultrasound, but they didn't find any joint effusion. They dismissed it as transient hips arthritis and treated him with anti-inflammatory therapy.
Doctor: Did the therapy help with his condition?
Patient: Unfortunately, no. His pain got worse, and now he's unable to walk. That's why we came back here.
Doctor: We should definitely investigate further. We'll start by admitting him to the hospital. We'll need to perform a spine radiograph and an MRI to determine what's causing his condition. 
Patient: Okay, thank you.
[After the tests]
Doctor: I've reviewed the test results. The spine radiograph showed a slight reduction in the thickness of the L5 soma. The MRI revealed increased T1 post-enhancement signals in the L4-L5 anulus, the opposite end-plates of L4 and L5, the adjacent soft tissues, and the osteolytic area of the L5 pedicle. These findings suggest that your son has Spondylodiscitis with associated osteomyelitis.
Patient: Oh no! What about his blood tests?
Doctor: The blood tests showed an increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (77 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (2.17 mg/dL). However, his white blood cell count, procalcitonin serum concentration, and Quantiferon TB-gold test are all within normal ranges. 
Patient: What's the treatment plan for his condition?
Doctor: We'll start him on broad-spectrum intravenous therapy, which includes meropenem (100 mg/kg/day in three doses) and vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day in three doses). We'll continue the anti-inflammatory treatment for the first week and then stop it once his symptoms have resolved and he can walk normally again.
Patient: How long will the treatment last?
Doctor: The treatment may last for a few weeks. We'll closely monitor his progress and adjust the treatment as needed.
Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor.
[After 3 weeks of therapy]
Doctor: I wanted to update you on your son's condition. Unfortunately, he has developed leukopenia with severe neutropenia. His white blood cell count dropped to its lowest at 5410/mm3.
Patient: Oh no, is there anything we can do?
Doctor: We'll continue to closely monitor his condition and tailor his treatment as necessary. In the meantime, it's important for you to keep an eye on any changes in his symptoms and report them to us immediately. We'll do our best to help him recover.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help.","S: The patient, a 21-month-old male, presented with weakness in his lower extremities and lumbar pain following a mild upper respiratory tract infection. Initial treatment with anti-inflammatory therapy for suspected transient hips arthritis was ineffective, leading to worsening pain and inability to walk.
O: Hip ultrasound showed no joint effusion. Spine radiograph revealed slight reduction in the thickness of the L5 soma. MRI indicated increased T1 post-enhancement signals in the L4-L5 anulus, opposite end-plates of L4 and L5, adjacent soft tissues, and osteolytic area of the L5 pedicle.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I came here because for the past 2 months, I've been experiencing fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, loss of appetite, and mild abdominal discomfort. I don't have fever, chills, cough, nausea, vomiting, itching, or any urinary or bowel problems.
Doctor: I see. Can you please tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: Sure. I was diagnosed with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis of the mediastinal lymph nodes 9 years ago. I had hilar lymphadenopathy seen on a routine chest radiography back then. The disease has been inactive, and I've never had symptoms related to it or received any treatment. I also have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder, coronary artery disease with percutaneous coronary intervention performed a month before this presentation, and recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. What medications are you currently taking?
Patient: I'm taking amlodipine, metoprolol tartrate, lisinopril, lamotrigine, clopidogrel, metformin, rosuvastatin, and sildenafil.
Doctor: Do you have a history of alcohol or tobacco use?
Patient: No, I don't have any history of alcohol or tobacco use. I used to work as a secretary.
Doctor: Alright. Let's perform a physical examination. *After examination* Your vital signs are normal. Your body mass index is 37.2 kg/m2, and your weight is 263 pounds. The general, lung, heart, and abdominal examinations are unremarkable, and there's no palpable lymphadenopathy.
Doctor: We need to perform a battery of laboratory tests to further investigate your symptoms. *After tests* Your alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels are within normal limits. However, your alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels are elevated (ALP = 258 U/L, reference = 38-126 U/L; GGT = 274 U/L, reference = 12-73 U/L). You also have hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin is 1.7 mg/dL, reference = 0.0-1.3 mg/dL, and direct bilirubin is 0.7 mg/dL, reference = 0.0
Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: These elevated levels indicate that there might be an issue with your liver function. We will need to further investigate the cause and determine the appropriate treatment. In the meantime, please continue taking your medications as prescribed and monitor your symptoms.

"Doctor: Hello, Patient D. How are you feeling today?
Patient D: I'm feeling fine, doc, no complaints. Just here for a regular check-up.
Doctor: That's good to hear. I see that you are a 60-year-old African American male and currently asymptomatic. I also noticed that your 62-year-old brother had prostate cancer and was successfully treated with radiation. Is that correct?
Patient D: Yes, that's correct. My brother went through radiation treatment and is doing well now.
Doctor: I'm glad to hear that your brother is doing well. Given your African American background and having a first-degree relative diagnosed with prostate cancer before 65 years of age, it's important to discuss the possibility of PSA testing with you.
Patient D: Hmm, okay. What exactly is PSA testing, doc?
Doctor: PSA testing, or Prostate-Specific Antigen testing, is a blood test that helps detect the presence of prostate cancer. However, the recommendations for PSA-based screening vary among different organizations.
Patient D: So, do I need to get this screening done?
Doctor: According to the AAFP, NCI, CDC, ACS, AUA, NCCN, and ASCO, it would be less difficult for clinicians to discuss PSA testing with you, considering your background and family history. These organizations recommend that we have a conversation about the potential benefits and risks of the test.
Patient D: Alright, I see. What do the USPSTF recommendations say?
Doctor: The USPSTF recommendations may not recommend PSA-based screening for you. It is important to understand that PSA testing has both potential benefits and risks, and the decision to undergo the test should be made after discussing these factors with your healthcare provider.
Patient D: I understand. So, what should I do next, doc?
Doctor: I recommend that we have a more detailed conversation about the potential benefits and risks of PSA testing, so you can make an informed decision. You may want to take some time to think about it and do some research before we discuss further.
Patient D: Okay, that sounds like a good plan. I'll do some more research and get back to you with any questions or concerns.
Doctor: That's a great approach. In the meantime, if you have any symptoms or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. I'll be here to help and guide you through the process.
Patient D: Thank you, doc. I appreciate your help and guidance.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you have a history of two early miscarriages and no long-term pregnancy. Can you please tell me about any symptoms you've been experiencing?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having irregular periods and noticed some excessive hair growth on my body.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Our physical examination did reveal hirsutism and menstrual irregularity. I also noticed in your medical history that you had an intramural myoma myomectomy operation through laparotomy, as well as disc hernia and peptic ulcer. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: I understand you've been married for 7 years and have undergone intrauterine insemination twice. We performed a chromosome analysis on your peripheral blood, and it revealed a marker chromosome: 47XX+m. 
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: In the ultrasonography examination, we observed a polycystic ovary appearance, but your uterus and endometrium were found to be normal. Based on these findings, our diagnosis is coherent with polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS. 
Patient: I had a feeling that might be the case.
Doctor: On the second day of your menstruation, we performed a hormonal analysis. The results were as follows: AMH- 6.4 ng / mL; Estradiol- 52.23 pg / mL; FSH- 6.16 mIU / mL; Lh- 21.22 mIU / mL; Prolactin- 10.35 ng / mL and TSH- 0.99 μIU / mL. Your semen analysis was normal.
Patient: That's good to know.
Doctor: Your current body weight is 64 kg, and your BMI is 25 kg / m2. After a genetic consultation, taking into account your polycystic ovary appearance, recurrent miscarriages, and marker chromosome, we are considering in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis as a potential plan for you.
Patient: Okay, what does that mean exactly?
Doctor: It means that we'll create embryos through IVF and then perform a preimplantation genetic diagnosis to identify any potential genetic issues before implanting the embryos. This can help reduce the risk of miscarriages and increase the chances of a successful pregnancy.
Patient: That sounds like a good plan. What are the next steps?
Doctor: The next steps will involve scheduling appointments for additional testing, monitoring your hormone levels, and starting the IVF process. Our team will be with you every step of the way to provide guidance and support.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the help and information.

She has a history of two early miscarriages, intrauterine insemination attempts, intramural myoma myomectomy, disc hernia, and peptic ulcer. She expressed concerns about her symptoms and potential diagnosis.
O: Physical examination confirmed hirsutism and menstrual irregularity. Chromosome analysis showed 47XX+m. Ultrasonography revealed polycystic ovaries with normal uterus and endometrium. Hormonal analysis results were: AMH- 6.4 ng/mL, Estradiol- 52.23 pg/mL, FSH- 6.16 mIU/mL, LH- 21.22 mIU/mL, Prolactin- 10.35 ng/mL, and TSH- 0.99 μIU/mL. Semen analysis was normal. Current body weight is 64 kg, BMI 25 kg/m2.
A: The primary diagnosis is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), supported by clinical findings of hirsutism, menstrual irregularity, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography. The presence of a marker chromosome and history of recurrent miscarriages suggest a genetic component to her infertility.
P: The management plan includes proceeding with in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis to address genetic concerns and enhance the probability of a successful pregnancy. The patient will undergo further hormonal monitoring and genetic counseling. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

Patient: Yeah, I was admitted to the hospital because I've been having shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion for the past 2 years. I also had an episode of presyncope about 2 weeks ago but didn't get any further evaluation.
Doctor: I see. Do you have any family history of diseases or any past history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, or sudden cardiac death?
Patient: No, I don't have any family history of diseases, and I haven't had any of those conditions myself either. I don't smoke or drink alcohol too.
Doctor: Good to know. I understand you've had stereotactic radiosurgeries twice in the past decade, and you've been following treatment with a somatostatin analog, octreotide, through intramuscular injections for about 20 years now?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Alright. I noticed that you are overweight and moderately nourished. Your height is 1.85 m (73 inches), and you weigh 134 kg, giving you a body mass index of 39 kg/m2.

You also have some distinct skeletal features, like enlargement of the tongue and lip, as well as large hands and feet. 
Patient: Hmm, yes, I've noticed that too.
Doctor: During the cardiac auscultation, we observed irregular premature beats, a pathological third heart sound, and a systolic murmur over the apex and aortic area. We also noted bilateral extensive borders of cardiac dullness. Your physiological reflexes are present without any pathology. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm with a wide QRS duration of left bundle branch block (LBBB). Based on this, your condition is classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage III–IV.
Patient: Oh, I didn't know it was that serious.
Doctor: On admission, we performed magnetic resonance imaging, which showed a pituitary macroadenoma. Given your symptoms, we also ran blood tests for myocardial injury markers, which revealed an elevated brain natriuretic peptide level of 740 pg/ml, indicating cardiac failure.
Patient: That doesn't sound good.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you've been referred here for further evaluations and a possible surgical operation for pancreatic head and neck carcinoma. Can you tell me about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been suffering from abdominal pain for about a year, and it has gotten more intense in the last 6 months. It's usually after I eat and it's in my right upper abdomen. I've also become icteric with generalized spread and itching for the past 2 months.
Doctor: I see. Do you have a history of alcohol consumption or smoking?
Patient: No, I don't.
Doctor: Alright. Based on your symptoms and medical history, the probable diagnosis is pancreatic head and neck carcinoma. We'll need to consult further to determine the best course of action for surgery. I understand you had a plastic stent implanted in the previous health center for duct dilation to relieve your symptoms. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: After your admission to our hospital, we've evaluated you with abdominal computed tomography (CT), endosonographic imaging, and a diagnostic ampullary biopsy. The abdominal CT scan with contrast exhibited an 18 mm x 20 mm hypodense mass at the head and neck of your pancreas. We also performed endosonographic imaging to rule out periampullary lesions, and found a 20 mm x 19 mm lesion in the pancreatic head and neck region. The main pancreatic duct was slightly dilated in the body of the pancreas and the common bile duct (CBD) was distally thickened and contained sludge.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We then performed a diagnostic biopsy for pathological assessment. The biopsy revealed an irregular gray-creamy soft tissue with undifferentiated malignant tumor features at microscopic evaluations.
Patient: So, what does that mean for me?
Doctor: Based on these findings, we decided to proceed with a Whipple procedure. However, during the surgery, after cutting the neck of the pancreas in the left side of the portal vein, the frozen section revealed more involvement of pancreatic tissue. We resected an additional 2 cm, but the pancreas residue still had tumor involvement, macroscopically. Therefore, we had to perform a total pancreatectomy.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: Postoperative pathological studies were established and indicated a tumor with the greatest dimension of 4 cm, which was extended to the duodenum. Invasion of the venous, lymphatic vessels, and perineural sites was seen. However, no further spread was detected.
Patient: What are the next steps for me?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your recovery and discuss any further treatments or follow-up requirements with you. It's important to keep us informed about any changes in your symptoms or condition.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us.","S: The patient reports a history of abdominal pain for approximately one year, worsening over the last six months, particularly postprandial and localized to the right upper abdomen.

A plastic stent was previously placed for duct dilation.
O: Physical examination revealed icterus. Abdominal CT scan with contrast showed an 18 mm x 20 mm hypodense mass at the head and neck of the pancreas. Endosonographic imaging identified a 20 mm x 19 mm lesion in the same region, slight dilation of the main pancreatic duct in the body, and thickening with sludge in the distal common bile duct. Diagnostic ampullary biopsy indicated undifferentiated malignant tumor features. During the Whipple procedure, extensive tumor involvement necessitated a total pancreatectomy. Postoperative pathology confirmed a 4 cm tumor extending to the duodenum with venous, lymphatic, and perineural invasion.
A: The primary diagnosis is pancreatic head and neck carcinoma with extensive local invasion, necessitating total pancreatectomy. Differential diagnoses considered were other periampullary lesions, which were ruled out by endosonographic imaging and biopsy.
P: The patient underwent a total pancreatectomy after intraoperative findings during a planned Whipple procedure. Postoperative management will include monitoring recovery and discussing further treatment or follow-up as needed.

Can you tell me about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I've been suffering from abdominal pain for about a year, and it has gotten more intense in the last 6 months. It's usually after I eat and it's in my right upper abdomen. I've also become icteric with generalized spread and itching for the past 2 months.\nDoctor: I see. Do you have a history of alcohol consumption or smoking?\nPatient: No, I don't.\nDoctor: Alright. Based on your symptoms and medical history, the probable diagnosis is pancreatic head and neck carcinoma. We'll need to consult further to determine the best course of action for surgery. I understand you had a plastic stent implanted in the previous health center for duct dilation to relieve your symptoms. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: After your admission to our hospital, we've evaluated you with abdominal computed tomography (CT), endosonographic imaging, and a diagnostic ampullary biopsy. The abdominal CT scan with contrast exhibited an 18 mm x 20 mm hypodense mass at the head and neck of your pancreas. We also performed endosonographic imaging to rule out periampullary lesions, and found a 20 mm x 19 mm lesion in the pancreatic head and neck region. The main pancreatic duct was slightly dilated in the body of the pancreas and the common bile duct (CBD) was distally thickened and contained sludge.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We then performed a diagnostic biopsy for pathological assessment. The biopsy revealed an irregular gray-creamy soft tissue with undifferentiated malignant tumor features at microscopic evaluations.\nPatient: So, what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, we decided to proceed with a Whipple procedure. However, during the surgery, after cutting the neck of the pancreas in the left side of the portal vein, the frozen section revealed more involvement of pancreatic tissue. We resected an additional 2 cm, but the pancreas residue still had tumor involvement, macroscopically. Therefore, we had to perform a total pancreatectomy.\nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: Postoperative pathological studies were established and indicated a tumor with the greatest dimension of 4 cm, which was extended to the duodenum. Invasion of the venous, lymphatic vessels, and perineural sites was seen. However, no further spread was detected.\nPatient: What are the next steps for me?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your recovery and discuss any further treatments or follow-up requirements with you. It's important to keep us informed about any changes in your symptoms or condition.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us.""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'S: The patient reports a history of abdominal pain for approximately one year, worsening over the last six months, particularly postprandial and localized to the right upper abdomen. Additionally, the patient has experienced jaundice and generalized itching for the past two months. The patient denies any history of alcohol consumption or smoking. A plastic stent was previously placed for duct dilation.\nO: Physical examination revealed icterus. Abdominal CT scan with contrast showed an 18 mm x 20 mm hypodense mass at the head and neck of the pancreas. Endosonographic imaging identified a 20 mm x 19 mm lesion in the same region, slight dilation of the main pancreatic duct in the body, and thickening with sludge in the distal common bile duct. Diagnostic ampullary biopsy indicated undifferentiated malignant tumor features. During the Whipple procedure, extensive tumor involvement necessitated a total pancreatectomy. Postoperative pathology confirmed a 4 cm tumor extending to the duodenum with venous, lymphatic, and perineural invasion.\nA: The primary diagnosis is pancreatic head and neck carcinoma with extensive local invasion, necessitating total pancreatectomy. Differential diagnoses considered were other periampullary lesions, which were ruled out by endosonographic imaging and biopsy.\nP: The patient underwent a total pancreatectomy after intraoperative findings during a planned Whipple procedure. Postoperative management will include monitoring recovery and discussing further treatment or follow-up as needed. The patient will be educated on signs of complications, such as infection or diabetes, due to total pancreatectomy, and will be advised to report any new symptoms.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've been referred to our hospital. Can you tell me what you've been experiencing?
Patient: Hi, I've been suffering from right ankle swelling since I was 7 years old. There's no pain and no limitation of movement, but it's really annoying.
Doctor: I see. What have you done to manage the swelling?
Patient: Well, I usually have a puncture and drainage of the joint when it swells up.
Doctor: Okay. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently?
Patient: Yes, one month before admission, I had an intermittent high fever along with joint swelling in my bilateral knees and right ankle.
Doctor: Did you have any imaging done for your joint swelling?
Patient: Yeah, I had Magnetic resonance imaging and it revealed a small amount of fluid collection in the joint space, but there was no evidence of synovitis.
Doctor: Have you tried any medications for your symptoms?
Patient: I started taking aspirin, but the intermittent fever continued.
Doctor: On admission, did you have any skin rash or eye involvement?
Patient: No, I didn't have any skin rash and no eye involvement was detected upon examination by an ophthalmologist.
Doctor: Let's discuss your blood examination results. Your normal white blood cell count was 9,000/μL, but your C-reactive protein level was elevated at 15.65 mg/dL, and your serum immunoglobulin G level was also elevated to 2,569 mg/dL. Your antinuclear antibody was borderline, but autoantibodies, including anti-dsDNA and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, were negative. Rheumatoid factor was also negative. Your blood chemistry and urine tests were unremarkable.
Patient: Oh, that's a lot of information. What does it mean?
Doctor: Based on these results and the absence of hilar lymphadenopathy and bone destructive changes in your right ankle despite your history of recurrent swelling, we can rule out some conditions. There's also no family history of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. So, we've diagnosed you with sJIA.
Patient: So, what's the treatment plan for sJIA?
Doctor: We started you on bolus methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3 days), followed by prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), ibuprofen (30 mg/kg/day), and methotrexate (15 mg/m2/week). Your fever has subsided with this treatment.
Patient: That's good to hear. What will happen if I reduce the dosage of prednisolone?
Doctor: We've tried reducing the dosage of prednisolone several times, but you began to experience swelling of several joints, including the right ankle. So, we need to continue monitoring your condition and adjust the treatment accordingly.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate your help.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to work together to manage your sJIA and keep you as comfortable as possible. Let's stay in touch and monitor your progress.","S: The patient, who has been experiencing right ankle swelling since age 7, reports no pain or movement limitation but finds the swelling annoying. The patient has a history of intermittent high fever and bilateral knee and right ankle swelling one month prior to admission.

Doctor: I see. It seems that you were in a pulseless electrical activity arrest. How long did it take for the emergency medical service to arrive?
Patient: It took them around 10 minutes to get there after my husband started CPR.
Doctor: During that time, you were given two doses of epinephrine before achieving return of spontaneous circulation. You were then taken to an outside hospital. At the hospital, you were hypotensive with a blood pressure of 50/41 mmHg, requiring vasopressor infusion. You also had expiratory wheezing, needing continuous nebulizer treatment. Your initial arterial blood gas showed a pH of < 6.8, carbon dioxide of 130 mmHg, and oxygen of 331 mmHg.
Patient: Yes, they gave me continuous albuterol treatments and made adjustments to the ventilator.
Doctor: After those treatments, your repeat arterial blood gas showed a pH of 6.81, PaCO2 of 138 mmHg, and PaO2 of 262 mmHg. On examination, you were comatose with fixed and dilated pupils (6 mm, nonreactive), and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3T. You were then transferred to our facility for consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
Patient: Okay, so what happened when I arrived here?
Doctor: Upon arrival, we sedated and paralyzed you to optimize ventilation and oxygenation prior to ECMO. We also performed a computed tomography (CT) scan of your head, which showed diffuse cerebral edema, indicating a severe anoxic brain injury.
Patient: Oh no, what was done after that?
Doctor: You were evaluated by our neurologic intensive care unit (NICU) team. They administered mannitol (100 g) and 23.4% (30 cc) to help with the cerebral edema, but there was no change in your neurological examination. We initiated veno-venous (V-V) ECMO with a flow of 4 LPM, speed of 3215 RPM, and FiO2 of 100% to support your oxygenation.

"Doctor: Hello, I remember you had an emergency caesarean delivery at 39 weeks due to fetal distress. How have you been since then? Any postpartum complications?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been doing well since the delivery. No complications, thankfully.
Doctor: That's good to hear. As part of our ongoing study on ""Vaginal delivery after caesarean section"", you underwent a saline contrast sonohysterography 6 months after the caesarean section. The results showed a small indentation in your caesarean scar, and the remaining myometrium over the defect was 7.5 mm (Fig. ). 
Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for my current pregnancy?
Doctor: At around 11 weeks, you had a dating scan with no remarks. Then, you came for a transvaginal ultrasound examination at around 13 weeks as part of our study. The scan revealed a duplex pregnancy with one viable intrauterine fetus with normal anatomy and placenta located high on the anterior wall. A small gestational sac (8 mm) with a yolk sac without an embryo was located in the caesarean scar (Fig. ). There was no extensive vascularity surrounding the sac, and you were asymptomatic.
Patient: Yes, that's right. I didn't feel any discomfort or symptoms.
Doctor: We informed you that there wasn't enough evidence to advise a specific management for this condition. After discussion with you and your husband, expectant management was chosen with a new ultrasound examination scheduled after 5 weeks.
Patient: Yes, we decided to wait and see how things would progress.
Doctor: You came to our ultrasound department at 18 weeks, 22 weeks, and 30 weeks of gestation. Throughout this time, you remained asymptomatic. The ectopic gestational sac was not visualized with transvaginal or transabdominal scans at the 18 weeks examination (Fig. ). The niche in the scar and the thickness of the thinnest part of the remaining myometrium appeared unchanged at all visits.
Patient: That's a relief. How's the intrauterine pregnancy developing?
Doctor: The intrauterine pregnancy developed normally with no signs of abnormal placentation. At 30 weeks of gestation, the ultrasound appearance of the scar area did not indicate any contraindications for vaginal delivery. The thickness of the lower uterine segment (LUS) was 4.9 mm (Fig. ).
Patient: So, I can have a vaginal delivery this time?
Doctor: Yes, in agreement with you, we've planned for a vaginal delivery. The staff of the labor ward has been fully informed and prepared for your case.
Patient: That's great news! Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. You'll be admitted to the labor ward when the time comes. Please continue to monitor your symptoms and reach out if you have any concerns. Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy.
Patient: Thank you so much, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance throughout this process.","S: The patient, a postpartum woman with a history of emergency caesarean delivery at 39 weeks due to fetal distress, reports no postpartum complications.

Patient: Yes, that's right. I had recurrent pneumonia and rib fractures as a baby.
Doctor: I see. You also had additional fractures of the extremities, rickets, and a short stature, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: In 1998, you had bilateral subtrochanteric femoral shaft pseudofractures after a fall down a flight of stairs. You were treated with intramedullary nail fixation at the time, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's what happened.
Doctor: In 2012, you suffered a left tibial fragility fracture from stepping off a sidewalk curb. How were you initially treated?
Patient: I had a cast, walking boot, cane, walker, and eventually became full non-weight-bearing due to the fracture not healing.
Doctor: I see. Your height, 138.4 cm (54.5″), is less than the mid-parental height of 174 cm (68.5″), and you are edentulous. Your baseline labs in November 2013 included ALP 8 U/L (38–126) and vitamin B6 2450 mcg/L (5–50). Gene testing showed compound heterozygous mutations c.526G>A (p.Ala176Thr) and c.1132G>C (pAsp378His). In December 2015, you started asfotase alfa, 1 mg/kg subcutaneous injection six times per week. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's what I've been taking.
Doctor: One month after starting asfotase alfa, you underwent elective osteotomy of the left tibia and fibula with intramedullary nail fixation.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented to our hospital with numbness and paralysis in your left foot. Can you tell me more about these symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been experiencing numbness and paralysis recently, and it's been affecting my daily activities.
Doctor: I understand. We conducted a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and found a tumor mass around the vertebral bodies. It's invading the spinal canal from L2 through L4 and compressing the dura mater. This could be the cause of your symptoms.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious.
Doctor: We also found multiple abnormal signals within the T12, L3-5 vertebral bodies. We performed a systemic examination using 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), which showed multiple nodular FDG uptakes in the vertebrae, ribs, pelvis, and femur.
Patient: What does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: It means there are multiple areas in your body with abnormal cell activity. We conducted needle biopsies of the L5 vertebra, but found no sign of tumor cells. Your cerebrospinal-fluid examinations were normal as well. To better understand the tumor, we performed partial excision of the tumor mass through a surgical procedure.
Patient: And what did you find?
Doctor: Microscopic examination revealed mononuclear tumor cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm infiltrating between the bone trabeculae. The tumor cells were positive for CD33 and CD68, and negative for CD3, CD20, CD34, and CD56, which confirmed the diagnosis of MS.
Patient: So, I have MS?
Doctor: Yes, based on these findings and laboratory tests, you've been diagnosed with de novo MS. Your blood count and coagulation tests showed no abnormalities, and there was no sign of leukemia in your bone marrow. Cytogenetic examination revealed 46, XY and was negative for translocation of PML/RARα and other balanced translocations routinely searched for in AML patients by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Patient: What's the next step for my treatment?
Doctor: We initially treated you with local irradiation to the vertebral tumor, which immediately resolved your neurological symptoms. Additionally, we treated you with daunorubicin and cytarabine, followed by a course of high-dose cytarabine.
Patient: Did the treatment work?
Doctor: At the end of chemotherapy, the PET/CT showed no abnormal uptake, which is a good sign. However, four months later, the MS relapsed as multiple tumors involving the right side of your body.
Patient: Oh no, what do we do now?
Doctor: We will need to discuss further treatment options and closely monitor your condition. It's important to stay positive and work closely with your medical team during this time. We'll do our best to support you and manage your symptoms as we explore potential treatments.","S: The patient reports experiencing recent numbness and paralysis in the left foot, significantly impacting daily activities.

"Doctor: Hi there, I understand you're scheduled to undergo split thickness skin grafts as part of a reconstructive program following your extensive burns from a house fire 2 years ago. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. I was burned pretty badly and suffered 93% total body surface area burns with a burn index of 85.
Doctor: I see your history shows you've already had 39 reconstructive operations over 2 years. Your neck was reconstructed using a graft from the latissimus dorsi, and both your femoral veins are occluded due to multiple accesses and indwelling catheters. I also noticed a subclavian venous catheter was inserted once before under ultrasound guidance. 
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: During your physical exam, we recorded your weight as 49 kg and your height as 155 cm. Most of your body is covered by hard contracted skin, and there were no peripheral veins evident on inspection. To obtain venous access for this operation, we used a linear probe ultrasound device on your chest and arm. 
Patient: Okay, what did you find?
Doctor: We found accessible veins, including the subclavian and axillary veins on the anterior chest, and the brachial vein of your right arm. We decided to use an indwelling catheter in the right brachial vein as the first choice to avoid possible complications of using the subclavian or axillary veins, such as pneumothorax or hemothorax. The right brachial vein measured 3 mm by ultrasound imaging.
Patient: Oh, I see. What's next?
Doctor: Due to extensive contractures, your right arm has a restricted motion range. We positioned you in the right semilateral position to gain easy access to the medial side of the arm by supination and abduction. A pillow was placed behind your back to maintain this position. 
Patient: Alright, what about the actual procedure?
Doctor: We prepped the skin of your arm with a 1% chlorhexidine alcohol solution and covered it with a sterile drape. We also covered the ultrasound probe with a sterile plastic probe cover. The indwelling venous catheter was placed using sterile barrier precautions.
Patient: And what about the pain?
Doctor: We injected a local anesthetic, 5 mL of 1% lidocaine, to numb the area. Then, a 20G catheter-over-the needle (48 mm) was inserted into the right brachial vein under ultrasound guidance.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate it.","S: The patient, a survivor of a house fire, suffered 93% total body surface area burns with a burn index of 85.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 3-year-old boy who was admitted to the emergency department with severe respiratory distress. Can you tell me what symptoms you were experiencing?
Patient: Yeah, I was having a really hard time breathing.
Doctor: I understand. It seems you had a pneumothorax on your right chest and underwent a tube thoracostomy. In your past medical history, you were free of symptoms and had no chronic disease, right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And none of your family members had lung disease or were smokers, correct?
Patient: Yes, no one in my family has lung disease or smokes.
Doctor: At admission, your vital signs were within normal limits except for a high respiratory rate of 45 per minute. Your total blood count, liver, and renal function tests were also unremarkable. During your physical examination, we noticed a 2x1 cm palpable mass on the right side of your neck. Did you notice this mass before?
Patient: No, I didn't know about it.
Doctor: A computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest revealed bilateral air cysts in varying sizes with a ground glass appearance. Pneumothorax was also detected. We performed a biopsy on the neck mass and diagnosed you with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) confined to the right salivary gland. The histopathologic features included polymorphonuclear leukocytes and atypical histocytes with oval nucleus and pale granular cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical staining with CD1a and S100 were positive.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We started you on chemotherapy including vinblastine and prednisone. However, during follow-up, your pneumothorax persisted, and we had to insert another chest tube on the left side. Unfortunately, you were unresponsive to medical treatment 2 weeks after admission.
Patient: So, what happened next?
Doctor: We performed a chemical pleurodesis with 2 cc of talc through the tube thoracostomy. No intrapleural analgesics were used. The tube was clamped for 1 hour and unclamped at the end of the procedure. During the clamped period, you were recommended to rotate on each side for 10 minutes.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: After 10 days of follow-up, you developed bilateral pneumothorax with subcutaneous emphysema despite the tube thoracostomy. We then performed a thoracoscopic bullae excision with pleural decortication 10 days after the talc pleurodesis.
Patient: What did the evaluation show?
Doctor: The histopathological evaluation of pleural biopsies obtained by thoracoscopy revealed inflammation and foreign bodies, which were talc particles. No lung biopsy was sampled during the bullae excision.
Patient: So, what happened after the surgery?
Doctor: After the surgical excision of subpleural bullae, you were symptom-free for only 1 week. We'll continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as needed.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient, a 3-year-old boy, presented with severe respiratory distress and difficulty breathing. He has no past medical history of chronic diseases and no family history of lung disease or smoking. The patient was unaware of a palpable mass on the right side of his neck until it was identified during the physical examination.
O: At admission, the patient's vital signs showed a high respiratory rate of 45 per minute, but other parameters were within normal limits. Laboratory tests including total blood count, liver, and renal function were unremarkable. A CT scan of the chest revealed bilateral air cysts and a ground glass appearance, with a pneumothorax also detected. A biopsy of the neck mass diagnosed Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) confined to the right salivary gland, with positive CD1a and S100 immunohistochemical staining. Despite initial chemotherapy with vinblastine and prednisone, the patient's pneumothorax persisted, leading to additional interventions including chemical pleurodesis and thoracoscopic bullae excision with pleural decortication. Histopathological evaluation of pleural biopsies showed inflammation and talc particles.
A: The primary diagnosis is Langerhans cell histiocytosis with complications including recurrent pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema. Differential diagnoses initially considered might have included other causes of neck masses and respiratory distress in a pediatric patient. The prognosis is cautious given the recurrent nature of the pneumothorax and the ongoing need for invasive procedures.
P: The management plan includes continued monitoring and supportive care. The patient will remain on chemotherapy for LCH and will undergo regular follow-ups to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment and manage any recurrent symptoms.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you developed heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy 12 years ago. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, doctor. My heart has been feeling weak and I've had trouble catching my breath.
Doctor: I see. You had a cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D; Medtronic® Viva XT CRT-D; AAI 60) implanted 7 years ago. This was to help with ventricular fibrillation (VF). Later, as a bridge to transplantation, you had a HeartMate II® LVAD implanted 4 years ago. No arrhythmia developed immediately after LVAD implantation, so your CRT-D shock therapy was turned off. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Your transthoracic echocardiographic study at the time of LVAD implantation showed a significant decrease in left ventricular (LV) contractility (ejection fraction; 13%), dilation of the left ventricle (51 mm in diastole), and trivial aortic regurgitation (AR) without opening of the aortic valve. However, your right ventricular (RV) contraction had maintained well relatively (RV fractional area change; 33%). 
Patient: Yes, I remember that.
Doctor: Eight months after LVAD implantation, you developed palpitations and were admitted to our hospital due to repeated VAs necessitating electrical defibrillation. Your echocardiography showed the left ventricle diameter did not change, but the right ventricle volume was slightly enlarged. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, I had to come in because of those palpitations.
Doctor: You were treated with various anti-arrhythmic agents, including amiodarone, nifekalant, mexiletine, and lidocain, but your condition progressed to sustained VF. This led to a hemodynamic compromise and liver congestion. We then tried a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, diuretics, and rotation speed optimization (from 8800 to 9600 rpm). These interventions reduced organ dysfunction, suggesting that minimum-required perfusion to vital organs was maintained even under sustained VF. You were followed up on an outpatient basis after that. Does that sound right?
Patient: Yes, that's what happened.
Doctor: About 2 years after the development of sustained VF, paroxysmal AF was detected on the monitoring records of your CRT-D, with a gradually increasing frequency. Do you remember that?
Patient: Yes, I do.
Doctor: After 3 years of sustained VF, you were readmitted to our hospital due to worsening of symptoms associated with right heart failure and liver congestion. Your total bilirubin level was elevated. How have you been feeling since then?
Patient: I've been feeling worse lately, and I'm really worried about my condition.
Doctor: I understand your concern. We will continue to closely monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as needed to help manage your symptoms. Please make sure to keep all your follow-up appointments and let us know if you experience any changes in your symptoms.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to do that.","S: The patient, with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure, reports feeling weak and having difficulty breathing. The patient has a history of ventricular fibrillation, for which a CRT-D was implanted 7 years ago, and a HeartMate II® LVAD was implanted 4 years ago as a bridge to transplantation. The patient experienced palpitations and sustained ventricular fibrillation (VF) post-LVAD implantation, leading to right heart failure symptoms and liver congestion recently.
O: The initial echocardiographic study at the time of LVAD implantation showed an ejection fraction of 13%, left ventricular dilation (51 mm in diastole), trivial aortic regurgitation, and relatively maintained right ventricular contraction (fractional area change; 33%). Recent findings include sustained VF, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) detected with increasing frequency, and elevated total bilirubin levels indicating worsening liver function. The patient has been treated with amiodarone, nifekalant, mexiletine, lidocaine, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, diuretics, and rotation speed optimization of the LVAD.
A: The primary diagnosis is advanced heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy with complications including sustained VF and right heart failure. Differential diagnoses could include progression of heart failure, arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy, or device-related complications. The prognosis is guarded given the complexity and progression of the disease.
P: Continue close monitoring of the patient's cardiac function and liver enzymes. Adjust medications as needed to manage arrhythmias and heart failure symptoms. Optimize LVAD settings to ensure adequate perfusion. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's condition and device function.

"Doctor: Hello, are you the patient from the gold mining region of the União do Norte district, Peixoto de Azevedo in northern Mato Grosso?
Patient: Yes, that's me.
Doctor: What brings you here today? What symptoms have you been experiencing?
Patient: I've been having fever, headache, myalgia, chest pain, dry cough, dizziness, asthenia, dyspnea, acute respiratory failure, and back pain.
Doctor: I see. We have admitted you to the hospital and conducted a laboratory test. The results revealed hemoconcentration (47.1%), thrombocytopenia (37,000/mm3), leukocytosis (22,180/mm3), increased urea and creatinine (72.56 mg/dL and 1.87 mg/dL, respectively), aspartate aminotransferase (102.4 IU), and alanine aminotransferase (57.14 IU). Unfortunately, we were not able to perform a chest X-ray.
Patient: Oh, okay. What does all that mean?
Doctor: These results indicate that you may have an infection. The analysis of the serum sample collected on the seventh day of the disease showed the presence of anti-hantavirus IgM antibodies, with negative IgG. We detected hantavirus Castelo dos Sonhos by RT-PCR.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is a serious condition. We have started a therapeutic strategy based on antibiotics associated with hemodynamic and respiratory support to treat your illness.
Patient: I hope it helps.
Doctor: We will do our best to help you recover. Unfortunately, the patient died nine days after the onset of the illness.
[The patient's family enters the conversation]
Family member: Doctor, what happened? 
Doctor: I'm sorry for your loss. Despite our efforts with the therapeutic strategy, the patient's condition did not improve. 
Family member: What will you do now?
Doctor: After the first occurrence of HPS in miners, we carried out a study to estimate the prevalence of anti-hantavirus antibodies in 112 samples previously collected from a population living in a mining area in the Três Fronteiras district in the city of Colniza, Mato Grosso. These serum samples were stored in the Malaria Biorepository of the University Hospital Júlio Muller following a malaria survey conducted in 2012.
Family member: Why are you using those samples?
Doctor: We are using these samples due to the physiogeographical and population similarities between this gold mining area and the area where the two fatal HPS cases, including your loved one, were identified. These two mining areas, even if geographically distant, are comparable because they are located in the Amazon biome and have the same environmental modifications from the garimpo.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're currently 9 weeks pregnant through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Can you tell me about your medical history?
Patient: Yes, I had one previous pregnancy with a normal delivery. I also have a history of asthma, but no history of blood cell transfusion or medication, except for the antibiotic cephem during ICSI to prevent infection.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. At your first visit, we administered a blood test which revealed that you are D-antigen-positive and irregular antibody-negative. Your hemoglobin concentration was 14.4 g/dl. Now, at 28 weeks of gestation, a recent blood test showed acute macrocytic anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 7.9 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume of 108.1 fl, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin of 35.3 pg. We performed a detailed examination to determine the reason for these results.
Patient: Oh wow, that sounds concerning. What could be causing this anemia?
Doctor: We considered several possibilities including Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome; hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS); and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), but these were unlikely. Systemic lupus erythematosus is reported as a disease that causes anemia, but it was also unlikely because a test for anti-nuclear antibody was negative. Your C3, C4, and erythrocyte-binding IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were also normal. We then suspected the presence of hemolytic anemia and performed several additional examinations.
Patient: So, what were the results of those additional examinations?
Doctor: We found an increase of reticulocyte and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and a marked decrease of haptoglobin (<10 mg/dl). Upon further examination of the LDH fractions, we observed that LDH1 and LDH2 were markedly increased. Your urine was negative for hemoglobin. These results strongly suggest the presence of hemolysis.
Patient: Oh no, what does that mean for me and my baby?
Doctor: It means that your body is breaking down red blood cells faster than it can produce them, causing anemia. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was positive for anti-IgG and negative for anti-C3d, while the indirect antiglobulin test was negative. There was no corresponding medical history or symptoms of infection that could have contributed to the observed hemolytic anemia. A blood test for cold agglutinins was also negative.
Patient: What should I do now? Are there any treatments or precautions I need to take?
Doctor: We will closely monitor your condition and may prescribe medication to manage the anemia. It's important to attend all your prenatal appointments, and we'll provide you with further guidance and recommendations as needed. It's essential to keep a close eye on your health and report any new symptoms immediately.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and will follow your advice.","S: The patient, a 28-week pregnant woman via intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), reports a history of one normal delivery and asthma.

Can you tell me about your medical history?\nPatient: Yes, I had one previous pregnancy with a normal delivery. I also have a history of asthma, but no history of blood cell transfusion or medication, except for the antibiotic cephem during ICSI to prevent infection.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. At your first visit, we administered a blood test which revealed that you are D-antigen-positive and irregular antibody-negative. Your hemoglobin concentration was 14.4 g/dl. Now, at 28 weeks of gestation, a recent blood test showed acute macrocytic anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 7.9 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume of 108.1 fl, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin of 35.3 pg. We performed a detailed examination to determine the reason for these results.\nPatient: Oh wow, that sounds concerning. What could be causing this anemia?\nDoctor: We considered several possibilities including Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome; hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS); and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), but these were unlikely. Systemic lupus erythematosus is reported as a disease that causes anemia, but it was also unlikely because a test for anti-nuclear antibody was negative. Your C3, C4, and erythrocyte-binding IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were also normal. We then suspected the presence of hemolytic anemia and performed several additional examinations.\nPatient: So, what were the results of those additional examinations?\nDoctor: We found an increase of reticulocyte and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and a marked decrease of haptoglobin (<10 mg/dl). Upon further examination of the LDH fractions, we observed that LDH1 and LDH2 were markedly increased. Your urine was negative for hemoglobin. These results strongly suggest the presence of hemolysis.\nPatient: Oh no, what does that mean for me and my baby?\nDoctor: It means that your body is breaking down red blood cells faster than it can produce them, causing anemia. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was positive for anti-IgG and negative for anti-C3d, while the indirect antiglobulin test was negative. There was no corresponding medical history or symptoms of infection that could have contributed to the observed hemolytic anemia. A blood test for cold agglutinins was also negative.\nPatient: What should I do now? Are there any treatments or precautions I need to take?\nDoctor: We will closely monitor your condition and may prescribe medication to manage the anemia. It's important to attend all your prenatal appointments, and we'll provide you with further guidance and recommendations as needed. It's essential to keep a close eye on your health and report any new symptoms immediately.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and will follow your advice.""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""S: The patient, a 28-week pregnant woman via intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), reports a history of one normal delivery and asthma.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having blurred vision in my left eye for a while now.
Doctor: I see. Do you have any past medical history or trauma history related to this issue?
Patient: No, I don't have any past medical history or trauma history.
Doctor: Alright, let's perform an ocular examination to check your vision. 
*After examination*
Doctor: Your best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is 0 logMAR in your right eye and Hand motion in your left eye. Your intraocular pressures are 17 mmHg in the right eye and 13 mmHg in the left eye. Unfortunately, the fundus in your left eye is invisible due to massive VH (Fig. a). We'll also check your blood pressure and perform some laboratory tests, including coagulating factors.
*After tests*
Doctor: Your blood pressure and laboratory test results are normal. Let's monitor your condition for a couple of weeks and see if there are any improvements.
*2 weeks later*
Patient: My vision seems to be a bit better now.
Doctor: That's good to hear. The VH has partially decreased, and your BCVA has improved to 0.4 logMAR in the left eye. No cause of VH other than the PHA was found (Fig. b). We'll perform a slit-lamp examination to further investigate.
*After slit-lamp examination*
Doctor: The examination demonstrated a Mittendorf's dot located in the inferior nasal quadrant of the posterior lens capsule in your left eye (Fig. ). We'll also perform optical coherence tomography (OCT) to get a better understanding of the issue.
*After OCT*
Doctor: OCT showed a hyporeflective tubular structure of the PHA and an elevated tissue structure of the optic nerve, which is Bergmeister's papilla (Fig. ). However, OCT angiography could not demonstrate the active blood flow of the PHA due to technical limitations. We were able to find the blood flow in the Bergmeister's papilla (Fig. ).
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: Fortunately, the VH spontaneously disappeared after 2 months, and no serious disorders have been observed in your left eye during the follow-up period. We'll continue to monitor your progress, but your condition seems to be improving.","S: The patient reports experiencing blurred vision in the left eye for an unspecified duration. The patient denies any relevant past medical or trauma history.
O: Initial ocular examination revealed a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0 logMAR in the right eye and Hand motion in the left eye. Intraocular pressures were 17 mmHg in the right eye and 13 mmHg in the left eye. Fundus examination of the left eye was obstructed by massive vitreous hemorrhage (VH). Blood pressure and laboratory tests including coagulation factors were within normal limits. Follow-up examination showed partial resolution of VH and improvement in BCVA to 0.4 logMAR in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination identified a Mittendorf's dot in the inferior nasal quadrant of the posterior lens capsule in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed a hyporeflective tubular structure consistent with persistent hyaloid artery (PHA) and an elevated tissue structure at the optic nerve identified as Bergmeister's papilla. OCT angiography was limited but showed blood flow in Bergmeister's papilla.
A: The primary diagnosis is persistent hyaloid artery with associated complications including vitreous hemorrhage and Bergmeister's papilla in the left eye. The spontaneous resolution of VH and absence of other serious disorders during follow-up are encouraging.
P: The management plan includes continued monitoring of the patient's ocular health with regular follow-up visits to assess any changes in vision or ocular structures. No specific treatment is required at this stage given the spontaneous resolution of VH and the stability of the patient's condition.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you're a 12-year-old female experiencing some persistent pain. Can you tell me more about it?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having this lower back pain and it's been going on for like 4 months. It also feels like it's going down both of my legs.
Doctor: I see. We performed an MRI lumbar spine on you, and it demonstrated an enhancing intradural, extramedullary lesion with adjacent dura thickening at the level of L2. To address this, we performed a laminectomy and excision of the lesion.
Patient: Oh, okay. So what did you find out from that?
Doctor: The histology results showed that you have a mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. It's a type of tumor that consists of round to spindle cells with interspersed cartilage and bone formation.
Patient: Hmm, that sounds serious. What else did you find out about the tumor?
Doctor: We found that the tumor cells showed diffuse CD99 immunoreactivity and negative staining for epithelial membrane antigen, STAT6, and glial fibrillary acid protein. The Ki-67 index, which helps us understand the aggressiveness of the tumor, was about 30%.
Patient: Oh, okay. What does that mean for me?
Doctor: It means that we need to monitor your condition closely and discuss the appropriate treatment options. We also performed the Archer™ FusionPlex Sarcoma Assay and detected 2 gene fusion transcripts: HEY1 (exon 4)-NCOA2 (exon 13) and HEY1 (exon 4)-NCOA2 (exon 14). This information can help guide your treatment plan.
Patient: Alright, so what are the next steps?

Doctor: Alright, and what about your familial target height?
Patient: It's on percentile 3-10.
Doctor: I see. How was your pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal period?
Patient: My mom said everything was uneventful.
Doctor: Okay. I understand that at the age of 5, you had aortic coarctation correction and were diagnosed with arterial hypertension. Are you currently being treated for that?
Patient: Yes, I started treatment with enalapril, and I have a follow-up at Cardiology.
Doctor: Good to know. How has your growth been throughout your childhood?
Patient: My height growth was on percentile 10-25 until I was 11, but it slowed down after that. My weight evolution was on percentile 25-50 until the age of 7, but then it increased a lot until percentile 97.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. I noticed during your observation that you presented with a round and red face, a large and short neck, cervical acanthosis nigricans, a well-muscled body, and melanocytic nevus on your back and limbs. Can you tell me about your pubertal development?
Patient: I have axillary hair, and my pubic hair is at Tanner stage 2. My penis is covered by prepubic fat, but it's normal consistency, and my testis are in the scrotum.
Doctor: What is your bilateral testicular volume?
Patient: It's 4 ml3.
Doctor: Thank you. We've conducted a thorough lab and imaging evaluation. Your blood count, albumin, renal and hepatic function, ionogram, and phosphocalcic metabolism are all normal. However, your lipidic and glucidic profile shows some areas of concern. Your total cholesterol is 219 mg/dL, which is higher than the reference range of less than 200 mg/dL. Your HDL is 55 mg/dL, which is lower than the desired range of greater than 60 mg/dL. Your LDL is 141 mg/dL, which is also higher than the reference range of less than 130 mg/dL. Lastly, your triglycerides are within the normal range at 115 mg/dL.
Patient: Oh, I didn't know my cholesterol was that high. What should I do to improve it?
Doctor: It's important to maintain a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and continue with your follow-up appointments at Cardiology. We'll keep monitoring your growth and development, and we're here to help you with any concerns or questions you may have.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll do my best to follow your advice and stay on top of my health.","S: The patient, a young male, presents with concerns about short stature. He reports a history of aortic coarctation correction at age 5 and ongoing treatment for arterial hypertension with enalapril. His familial target height is on the 3rd to 10th percentile. He describes his growth as initially within the 10th to 25th percentile for height until age 11, after which it slowed significantly. His weight was within the 25th to 50th percentile until age 7, then increased sharply to the 97th percentile. Pubertal development includes axillary hair, pubic hair at Tanner stage 2, and bilateral testicular volume of 4 ml^3. He has no significant family history of related conditions.
O: Physical examination revealed a round, red face, large and short neck, cervical acanthosis nigricans, well-muscled body, and melanocytic nevus on back and limbs. Laboratory tests showed normal blood count, albumin, renal and hepatic function, ionogram, and phosphocalcic metabolism. Lipid and glucidic profiles indicated elevated total cholesterol at 219 mg/dL (normal <200 mg/dL), low HDL at 55 mg/dL (desired >60 mg/dL), and elevated LDL at 141 mg/dL (normal <130 mg/dL). Triglycerides were normal at 115 mg/dL.
A: The patient is assessed with growth retardation potentially linked to his previous medical history and current findings. Differential diagnoses could include endocrine disorders such as growth hormone deficiency or Cushing's syndrome, given his physical features and slowed growth post-age 11. The lipid abnormalities suggest a risk for metabolic syndrome, which needs addressing given his cardiovascular history.
P: The management plan will include a referral to a dietitian for nutritional counseling to address his lipid profile and overall health. Regular physical activity will be encouraged. Continued follow-up in pediatric endocrinology and cardiology is necessary to monitor his growth, pubertal development, and cardiovascular health. Further endocrine evaluation, including growth hormone testing and possibly a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, may be considered to explore the cause of his growth retardation and physical symptoms. Compliance with medication and lifestyle modifications will be crucial, and patient education regarding his condition and treatment plan will be provided.","Create a Medical SOAP note summary from the dialogue, following these guidelines:

"Doctor: Hello, I'm your doctor. I understand you have no history of disease or medication. Can you tell me more about your lifestyle, such as your weight, smoking, and alcohol habits?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. Well, I'm slightly obese, and I'm a current smoker with over 50 pack-years. I also drink alcohol moderately.
Doctor: I see. You were admitted to the hospital with sudden onset hemoptysis and headache. At the regional hospital, you were diagnosed with hypertension. Your systolic blood pressure was 240 mmHg, and your diastolic blood pressure was 110 mmHg. Can you confirm that?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: A brain and chest computed tomography (CT) scan was performed. It showed no findings in your brain and alveoral hemorrhage in your chest. You also underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), which revealed mild to moderate mitral valve regurgitation and prolapse. Your blood tests were within normal rates. You were then transported to our hospital for further investigation and treatment.
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Upon your admission, your temperature was 37.6°C, heart rate 98 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and blood pressure 177/89 mmHg. Your arterial blood gas showed mild hypoxemia in room air with pH 7.47, pCO2 34 mmHg, pO2 68 mmHg, HCO3 18 mmol/L, and O2 saturation 93%. Your blood tests were normal again, except for elevated uric acid levels. We collected blood cultures and started you on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and oxygen supplementation due to hypoxemia.
Patient: Okay, I see.
Doctor: We performed another chest CT, which identified findings compatible with alveolar hemorrhage and consolidation in your right middle lobe. Your abdominal CT scan showed a slightly enlarged liver without focal lesions and bilateral, well-defined adrenal lesions, possibly adenomas. However, you refused to undergo a new brain CT or MRI scan.
Patient: Yes, I didn't want to do another brain scan.
Doctor: That's fine. Your pulmonary function tests showed obstructive lung disease, and bronchoscopy revealed blood clots in your right middle lobe. Your HIV-screening test and Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) were both negative.
Patient: Oh, alright.
Doctor: Based on these findings, we will continue your current treatment and monitor your progress. Please be sure to follow up with us as needed and work on quitting smoking and reducing alcohol consumption for your overall health.
Patient: Okay, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything to me.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've presented with a one-month history of chest pain. Have you had any recent surgery or trauma that might be related to this?
Patient: No, there's been no surgery or trauma.
Doctor: Alright, let's start by performing a thoracic computed tomographic (CT) scan to take a closer look. *After the scan* The CT scan revealed an ovoid soft tissue mass in the left posterior costophrenic angle, measuring about 4.3 cm×2.6 cm×5.8 cm.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We'll need to resect the mass under VATS. Intraoperatively, we found that the mass was closely located to the diaphragm. Initially, it was diagnosed as a neurogenic tumor of the mediastinum, but the final pathology showed it was a bronchogenic cyst.
Patient: Okay, so what's the next step?
Doctor: The operative course was uneventful, and we inserted a chest tube through the camera port at the 7th intercostals space midaxillary line. Nothing special was noted on the first day after surgery, but on the second day, you experienced two episodes of hypotension.
Patient: Yeah, I remember feeling really weak.
Doctor: We treated the hypotension with fluid expansion since there was no evidence of active bleeding from the chest tube. However, you suddenly presented with hemorrhagic shock and cardiac arrest, evident by a gush of blood from the chest tube.
Patient: That was so scary!
Doctor: We performed resuscitation and stabilization, and then you underwent emergent thoracotomy. After clearing the blood clots inside the chest, we found that the pericardium was distended by accumulated blood. Further inspection revealed active bleeding coming from a 3 mm hole on the pericardium.
Patient: Oh my god...
Doctor: We opened the pericardium to relieve the cardiac tamponade. The bleeding was found to be originating from an injured obtuse marginal artery of the left coronary artery. Because the injury was at the distal end of the obtuse marginal artery, we directly closed it with 4-0 prolene.
Patient: So, is everything okay now?
Doctor: Yes, you were successfully weaned from the ventilator on the 2nd postoperative day and finally discharged from the hospital. We'll keep monitoring your recovery, and you should follow up with any recommended appointments.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you had any prior risk factors for coronary artery disease?
Patient: No, I've been healthy and never had any issues before.
Doctor: Alright, let's start with some tests. We'll check your hemoglobin level and perform a computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest and abdomen. We'll also do an electrocardiogram (EKG) and check your troponin levels to assess your heart function.
Patient: Sure, doc.
*After tests*
Doctor: Your test results are in. Your hemoglobin level is 8.7 g/dl, and the CT scan revealed a splenic hematoma. Your EKG and troponin levels were normal at the time of admission. We'll discharge you with pain medications, and you should return if symptoms persist.
Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor.

Your hemoglobin level is stable at 8 g/dL, and your thyroid stimulating hormone and B-type natriuretic peptide are normal. There's no acute process seen on cardiopulmonary imaging. The initial EKG shows a first-degree heart block during this presentation.
Patient: What does that mean, doc?
Doctor: We performed a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) which showed an ejection fraction of 60% with no valvular or wall motion abnormalities. However, a repeat EKG three hours later demonstrated progression to a second-degree (Mobitz type 1) atrioventricular heart block (AVB).
Patient: Oh no, is that serious?
Doctor: A radionuclide stress test indicated a small and fixed defect of mild severity in the mid-anteroseptal and apical anterior location, consistent with myocardial infarction. As your symptoms persisted, we performed another EKG six hours later, which showed a complete heart block.
Patient: What can be done about this?
Doctor: We managed this urgently with a successful dual-chamber pacemaker, which should help resolve your symptoms and normalize your troponin levels. You'll be discharged home tomorrow.

Doctor: Were there any prior episodes of dehydration or intercurrent illnesses before these symptoms appeared?
Patient's mother: No, there were no prior episodes of dehydration or any preceding or intercurrent illnesses.
Doctor: How about his medical history? Has he been taking any prescribed or over-the-counter medications?
Patient's mother: He has no prior medical history and hasn't been taking any prescribed or over-the-counter medications.
Doctor: Is there any family history of diabetes insipidus?
Patient's mother: No, there's no family history of diabetes insipidus.
Doctor: I noticed in his social history that you returned to work prior to the onset of symptoms. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient's mother: Yes, I started working again shortly before his symptoms began.
Doctor: I see. Now, for the evaluation done, his serum sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine level, insulin-like growth factor, cortisol, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and prolactin were all normal. His random arginine vasopressin level was 1.4 pg/mL, which is within the normal range of 1–13.3 pg/mL, and his random urine osmolality was 285 mOsm/kg.
Doctor: A head MRI did not reveal any pituitary or other intracranial pathologies, and a renal ultrasound showed a right kidney with a duplicated collecting system with mild prominence of the lower pole of the renal pelvis. An informal water deprivation test was conducted at home. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient's mother: Yes, we were instructed to limit his water intake at home overnight and return for laboratory evaluation in the morning. His urine osmolality was 683 mOsm/kg after 12 hours of water deprivation. But at the end of the water deprivation, I had to give him water to stimulate diuresis. No serum osmolality or sodium levels were collected.
Doctor: Based on this, your son was diagnosed with partial diabetes insipidus and started on oral desmopressin (DDAVP). I see that the dose of DDAVP was titrated up to 0.2 mg twice daily for effect. How has he been since starting this medication?

If you notice any changes in his symptoms or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.","S: The patient, a young child, presented with symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia, consuming 3-4 liters of water daily and experiencing frequent heavy wet diapers. Symptoms started suddenly four months ago. The patient also shows decreased appetite and a recent weight loss of 1 pound. There is no prior or family history of similar symptoms or diabetes insipidus. The patient's mother noted these symptoms began shortly after she returned to work.
O: Physical examination and laboratory tests showed normal serum sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine level, insulin-like growth factor, cortisol, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and prolactin levels. Random arginine vasopressin was 1.4 pg/mL (normal range 1–13.3 pg/mL), and random urine osmolality was 285 mOsm/kg. MRI of the head and renal ultrasound were unremarkable except for a duplicated collecting system in the right kidney. A home water deprivation test increased urine osmolality to 683 mOsm/kg after 12 hours.
A: The patient was diagnosed with partial diabetes insipidus based on the clinical presentation and response to water deprivation. The absence of other significant findings in the lab results and imaging supports this diagnosis.
P: The patient was started on oral desmopressin (DDAVP) 0.2 mg twice daily, which has effectively resolved the symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia.

Can you tell me more about the symptoms he's been experiencing?\nPatient's mother: Sure, it started suddenly about four months ago. He's been drinking between 3 and 4 liters of water per day and having frequent heavy wet diapers. He also has a decreased appetite and lost 1 pound in weight.\nDoctor: Were there any prior episodes of dehydration or intercurrent illnesses before these symptoms appeared?\nPatient's mother: No, there were no prior episodes of dehydration or any preceding or intercurrent illnesses.\nDoctor: How about his medical history? Has he been taking any prescribed or over-the-counter medications?\nPatient's mother: He has no prior medical history and hasn't been taking any prescribed or over-the-counter medications.\nDoctor: Is there any family history of diabetes insipidus?\nPatient's mother: No, there's no family history of diabetes insipidus.\nDoctor: I noticed in his social history that you returned to work prior to the onset of symptoms. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient's mother: Yes, I started working again shortly before his symptoms began.\nDoctor: I see. Now, for the evaluation done, his serum sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine level, insulin-like growth factor, cortisol, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and prolactin were all normal. His random arginine vasopressin level was 1.4 pg/mL, which is within the normal range of 1–13.3 pg/mL, and his random urine osmolality was 285 mOsm/kg.\nDoctor: A head MRI did not reveal any pituitary or other intracranial pathologies, and a renal ultrasound showed a right kidney with a duplicated collecting system with mild prominence of the lower pole of the renal pelvis. An informal water deprivation test was conducted at home. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient's mother: Yes, we were instructed to limit his water intake at home overnight and return for laboratory evaluation in the morning. His urine osmolality was 683 mOsm/kg after 12 hours of water deprivation. But at the end of the water deprivation, I had to give him water to stimulate diuresis. No serum osmolality or sodium levels were collected.\nDoctor: Based on this, your son was diagnosed with partial diabetes insipidus and started on oral desmopressin (DDAVP). I see that the dose of DDAVP was titrated up to 0.2 mg twice daily for effect. How has he been since starting this medication?\nPatient's mother: His polyuria and polydipsia have resolved after starting the medication, and he's been doing much better.\nDoctor: That's great to hear.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that your 3-year-old boy presented to another hospital with a 5-day history of respiratory distress and retching. Can you tell me more about his symptoms?
Parent: Yes, he was struggling to breathe and kept retching. It was quite distressing for him.
Doctor: I understand. The initial chest X-ray at the outside hospital showed a left-sided tension pneumothorax with mediastinal shift and the suspicion of bowel loops in the left lower hemithorax. That's why the patient was transferred to our institution for further examination and treatment.
Parent: I see. What happened after he was admitted here?
Doctor: On admission, he showed severe dyspnea, had a temperature of 39.5°C, and tachycardia of 200/min. To address his breathing issue, we performed an immediate endotracheal intubation.
Parent: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it was necessary to stabilize his condition. After that, we performed a thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan which confirmed a left-sided enterothorax with mediastinal shift. We then inserted a left-sided chest tube to drain the fluid that was initially considered to be old blood.
Parent: What were the next steps?
Doctor: Due to the sudden onset of symptoms and a normal chest X-ray from the age of 1 year, we considered a diaphragmatic rupture as a differential diagnosis. So, we took your boy to the operation room (OR) immediately for a diagnostic laparoscopy.
Parent: What did you find during the operation?
Doctor: We detected a left-sided Bochdalek hernia with herniation of the small intestine, spleen, and stomach into the chest. Bile-stained fluid was found in the thorax and abdomen. We repositioned the herniated organs back into the abdomen and discovered a gastric perforation at the lesser curvature, which explained the pneumothorax he was experiencing.
Parent: Oh no, what did you do then?
Doctor: We decided that the gastric perforation couldn't be closed safely laparoscopically, so we performed a conversion to laparotomy. We closed the gastric perforation and repaired the diaphragmatic hernia with interrupted stitches.
Parent: How did he recover after the surgery?
Doctor: After extubation on the fourth postoperative day, a retrovesical abscess was detected and drained 30 days after the surgery. Due to gastroparesis, your boy showed a prolonged recovery and was finally discharged after 4 to 5 weeks in good condition.
Parent: I'm glad he recovered well. How is he doing now?
Doctor: After a follow-up of 2 years, your boy is asymptomatic and doing well. We will continue monitoring his progress, but so far, everything looks good.
Parent: Thank you, doctor, for explaining everything so clearly and taking care of our son. We appreciate your help.","S: The patient, a 3-year-old boy, presented with a 5-day history of respiratory distress and retching.

"Doctor: Hi there! I see that you are a 52-year-old female with no significant past medical history. What brings you here today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been experiencing some left lower quadrant abdominal pain lately.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's discuss your family history a bit. I see that your brother had lung cancer at the age of 62 years and had a risk factor of chronic smoking. Your paternal grandmother had bilateral synchronous breast cancer at 80, and your grandfather had prostate cancer at 79. Is there any family history of gastrointestinal or ovarian cancer?
Patient: No, there's no family history of gastrointestinal or ovarian cancer that I'm aware of.
Doctor: Thank you for that information. We'll need to perform a physical examination and a CT scan of your abdomen to identify any issues. 
(After the examination and CT scan)
Doctor: The CT scan of your abdomen showed an obstructed rectosigmoid mass. We then performed a colonoscopy which revealed a recto sigmoid mass measuring 4.5 × 6.5 cm, located 18 cm from the anal verge. The biopsy results indicate a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What about the CT scan of the chest? Did it show any distant metastases?
Doctor: Fortunately, the CT scan of the chest and abdomen did not show any evidence of distant metastases. We went ahead with a laparoscopic rectosigmoid and local lymph node resection with a left end colostomy. The pathology showed an invasive, moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma with infiltration beyond the muscularis propria into subserosal tissue.
Doctor: There were high-risk features, including lymphovascular and perineural invasion. Six of the twenty-eight lymph nodes we analyzed were positive for adenocarcinoma.
Patient: So what does all this mean for me? 
Doctor: After your colectomy, we sent the initial surgical specimen for analysis with next-generation sequencing. The tumor mutations included BRIP1 P619Fs*20, TP53 S2151, splice site 783-2A > G, CDK8 amplification was equivocal, and APC E 1295*. Your Lynch syndrome screen by immunohistochemistry (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 proteins) showed normal expression in pathological tissue. There were no reportable alterations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF.
Patient: I had colon cancer at such a young age with no family history. Can we do an evaluation of a possible hereditary predisposition?
Doctor: Yes, we performed an initial testing with a commercially available 17-gene colon cancer risk panel, and the results were negative. However, we proposed additional germline testing for the BRIP1 gene mutation based on the high allele frequency of the BRIP1 mutation found in your tumor.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything so clearly. What are the next steps for me?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide you with any necessary follow-up care. It is important for you to maintain a healthy lifestyle and keep an eye on any new symptoms that may arise. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

Doctor: I understand. You also had an important abdominal surgery due to gastric carcinoma three months ago, right?
Patient: Yes, I had a gastrectomy, lymphadenectomy, and an esophageal stent because of esophageal anastomosis insufficiency during that surgery.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. When you initially presented with chills and recurrent tumble at your family doctor, you were admitted to another hospital. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: When you were admitted, your inflammation parameters increased despite antibiotic therapy, and you had a recurrent fever. That's when your medication was changed from amoxicillin to piperacillin/tazobactam. Can you confirm that?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: We took three independent sets of peripheral blood cultures before starting the changed antibiotic, and all three sets showed Lactobacillus species. Have you been taking any probiotics recently?
Patient: No, I haven't taken any probiotics.
Doctor: We suspected endocarditis because of bacteremia with Lactobacillus, recurrent symptoms, worsening of your condition, and persistent infection despite antibiotic treatment. When you were admitted here, you were febrile with a temperature of 38.3°C, somnolent, and complained of generalized fatigue and malaise. Your heart rate was 85 bpm, and your blood pressure was 110/75 mmHg. Is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, that's how I felt.

Can you tell me more about it?\nPatient: Yes, I was treated with antibiotics for about two weeks in another hospital before coming here. The symptoms just didn't go away.\nDoctor: I understand. You also had an important abdominal surgery due to gastric carcinoma three months ago, right?\nPatient: Yes, I had a gastrectomy, lymphadenectomy, and an esophageal stent because of esophageal anastomosis insufficiency during that surgery.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. When you initially presented with chills and recurrent tumble at your family doctor, you were admitted to another hospital. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: When you were admitted, your inflammation parameters increased despite antibiotic therapy, and you had a recurrent fever. That's when your medication was changed from amoxicillin to piperacillin/tazobactam. Can you confirm that?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: We took three independent sets of peripheral blood cultures before starting the changed antibiotic, and all three sets showed Lactobacillus species. Have you been taking any probiotics recently?\nPatient: No, I haven't taken any probiotics.\nDoctor: We suspected endocarditis because of bacteremia with Lactobacillus, recurrent symptoms, worsening of your condition, and persistent infection despite antibiotic treatment. When you were admitted here, you were febrile with a temperature of 38.3°C, somnolent, and complained of generalized fatigue and malaise. Your heart rate was 85 bpm, and your blood pressure was 110/75 mmHg. Is that accurate?\nPatient: Yes, that's how I felt.\nDoctor: Our clinical examination revealed a grade 2/6 systolic murmur loudest at the apex, and we found no painful haemorrhagic spots on your left hand fingertips, which are known as Janeway lesions. Lung auscultation and chest X-ray showed no anomalies. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that sounds right.\nDoctor: We performed some laboratory studies that showed you have normocytic anaemia with a haemoglobin of 9.0 g/dl and MCV of 85.0 fl. Your white blood cell count was regular at 8,960/µl, but you had a reduced platelet count of 123,000/µl, elevated C-reactive protein of 12.6 mg/dl, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase of 310 U/l. \nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: To further investigate, we performed a transesophageal echocardiogram.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you were diagnosed with SLE three years ago. Can you tell me about the symptoms you've experienced so far?
Patient: Yeah, I've had skin lesions, alopecia, and my tests showed I was ANA positive.
Doctor: I see, and it also says here that you've tested positive for anti-Sm, anti-dsDNA, and had complement consumption. Now, let's talk about your recent condition. What symptoms led to your admission three months ago?
Patient: I developed lupus nephritis with some pretty bad symptoms like nephrotic range proteinuria, dysmorphic hematuria, and a positive direct Coombs test.
Doctor: I understand, and it looks like your nephritis was treated with endovenous corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. How have you been feeling since then?
Patient: I was actually admitted again because I had a fever, mental disorientation, and even hallucinations.
Doctor: That must have been concerning. It seems that you were empirically treated with antibiotics during that admission. Were there any other tests or treatments done at that time?
Patient: They did a screening for CMV infection, and it was positive but had low pp65 antigenemia. They didn't give me any specific treatment for it though.
Doctor: Okay, it's good that they checked for CMV infection. It's possible that your symptoms were related to that, but since your pp65 antigenemia levels were low, they may have decided not to treat it specifically. How have you been feeling since that last admission?
Patient: I've been feeling much better, actually. The fever, disorientation, and hallucinations have all gone away.
Doctor: That's great to hear. It seems like the antibiotics and other treatments have helped. Make sure to continue monitoring your symptoms and reach out to us if you experience any changes. We'll also need to follow up with you regularly to ensure your lupus nephritis remains under control.

"Doctor: Hi there, I'm Dr. Smith. I understand your 8-month-old female infant had a coronary reimplantation at age 3 months for ALCAPA. How has she been since the surgery?
Patient's parent: She seemed to be doing better at first, but lately, she's been having some issues.
Doctor: I see. What kind of issues has she been experiencing?
Patient's parent: She's been having trouble breathing, and she hasn't been growing as expected.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Her postsurgical ejection fraction did show early improvement, but it seems there has been some subsequent deterioration. We performed a diagnostic left heart catheterization as part of a heart transplant evaluation and discovered severe ostial stenosis of the LMCA. This could be the reason for her symptoms.
Patient's parent: Oh no, that sounds serious. What can be done about it?
Doctor: We've decided to refer her for PCI of the left main coronary artery to relieve her heart failure and preempt the need for a heart transplant. Her physical exam was significant for congestive heart failure and failure to thrive. The echocardiogram showed markedly depressed left ventricular function.
Patient's parent: Okay, so what does the procedure involve?
Doctor: A cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) and initial diagnostic nonselective root aortogram were performed, which demonstrated stenosis of the LMCA at the site of ALCAPA reimplantation. The procedure was carried out in the Pediatric Cardiology interventional suite after extensive discussion and planning with Pediatric and Adult Interventional Cardiology, Pediatric Cardiac Anesthesia, Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, and Pediatric Cardiac Radiology teams.
Patient's parent: That sounds like a lot of experts involved. How was the procedure done?
Doctor: We used general anesthesia and a femoral arterial approach. An ascending aortic root angiogram was obtained in 2 planes to assess the ostial left main stenosis. Due to the small size of the infant's aorta, a 6 Fr JR-4 guide was reshaped to engage the left main coronary artery. A BMW wire was used to cross the lesion.
Patient's parent: And what happened next?
Doctor: Since the infant's left main coronary artery was small but expected to grow with age, we implanted a somewhat larger (3.0 × 8 mm Vision bare metal) stent at less than nominal pressure to avoid distal dissection. However, a post-stent angiogram showed that the stent had moved during implantation, missing the ostium and leaving residual stenosis of the LMCA origin.
Patient's parent: Oh dear, what did you do then?
Doctor: We then placed a 3.5 × 8 mm Vision bare metal stent into the LMCA ostium, overlapping with the previous stent distally and protruding 1-2 millimeters into the aorta proximally. This should help improve the blood flow in her heart.
Patient's parent: I hope that helps her. What should we expect in terms of recovery and follow-up?
Doctor: She will need close monitoring to ensure the stents are functioning properly and her heart function improves. We will schedule regular follow-up appointments and echocardiograms to track her progress. If you notice any concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact us.
Patient's parent: Thank you, Dr. Smith. We appreciate all the care and attention our daughter is receiving.","S: The patient, an 8-month-old female infant, had a coronary reimplantation at 3 months for ALCAPA. Recently, she has been experiencing trouble breathing and poor growth. The parent reports initial improvement post-surgery, but deterioration in symptoms lately.
O: Physical examination indicates congestive heart failure and failure to thrive. Diagnostic left heart catheterization revealed severe ostial stenosis of the LMCA. Echocardiogram showed markedly depressed left ventricular function. A cardiac CTA and aortogram confirmed LMCA stenosis at the site of ALCAPA reimplantation. Intervention included placement of a 3.0 × 8 mm and subsequently a 3.5 × 8 mm Vision bare metal stent in the LMCA.
A: Primary diagnosis is severe ostial stenosis of the LMCA post-ALCAPA reimplantation, leading to congestive heart failure and failure to thrive. The differential diagnosis could include other causes of pediatric heart failure and growth delay, but these are less likely given the clear findings related to LMCA stenosis.
P: The management plan includes close monitoring of stent function and cardiac status with regular follow-up appointments and echocardiograms.

Her physical exam was significant for congestive heart failure and failure to thrive. The echocardiogram showed markedly depressed left ventricular function.\nPatient's parent: Okay, so what does the procedure involve?\nDoctor: A cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) and initial diagnostic nonselective root aortogram were performed, which demonstrated stenosis of the LMCA at the site of ALCAPA reimplantation. The procedure was carried out in the Pediatric Cardiology interventional suite after extensive discussion and planning with Pediatric and Adult Interventional Cardiology, Pediatric Cardiac Anesthesia, Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, and Pediatric Cardiac Radiology teams.\nPatient's parent: That sounds like a lot of experts involved. How was the procedure done?\nDoctor: We used general anesthesia and a femoral arterial approach. An ascending aortic root angiogram was obtained in 2 planes to assess the ostial left main stenosis. Due to the small size of the infant's aorta, a 6 Fr JR-4 guide was reshaped to engage the left main coronary artery. A BMW wire was used to cross the lesion.\nPatient's parent: And what happened next?\nDoctor: Since the infant's left main coronary artery was small but expected to grow with age, we implanted a somewhat larger (3.0 × 8 mm Vision bare metal) stent at less than nominal pressure to avoid distal dissection. However, a post-stent angiogram showed that the stent had moved during implantation, missing the ostium and leaving residual stenosis of the LMCA origin.\nPatient's parent: Oh dear, what did you do then?\nDoctor: We then placed a 3.5 × 8 mm Vision bare metal stent into the LMCA ostium, overlapping with the previous stent distally and protruding 1-2 millimeters into the aorta proximally. This should help improve the blood flow in her heart.\nPatient's parent: I hope that helps her. What should we expect in terms of recovery and follow-up?\nDoctor: She will need close monitoring to ensure the stents are functioning properly and her heart function improves. We will schedule regular follow-up appointments and echocardiograms to track her progress. If you notice any concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact us.\nPatient's parent: Thank you, Dr. Smith. We appreciate all the care and attention our daughter is receiving.""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'S: The patient, an 8-month-old female infant, had a coronary reimplantation at 3 months for ALCAPA.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you are a 42-year-old nulliparous woman with a history of infertility and recurrent catamenial pneumothorax. You've been referred to our emergency department due to right-sided chest pain and mild dyspnea within 48 hours of onset of menses. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. I've had two previous episodes of catamenial pneumothorax, with the last one happening six months ago.
Doctor: I see. Have you ever had a history of endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, or dyspareunia?
Patient: No, I've never experienced any of those symptoms.
Doctor: Okay. We performed an initial examination, which included a chest X-ray that revealed a right pneumothorax. To confirm the diagnosis, we also conducted a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. 
Patient: Hmm, I see. What did the CT scan show?
Doctor: The CT scan confirmed the presence of a right pneumothorax. We then performed Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) to treat the issue.
Patient: What did you find during the VATS procedure?
Doctor: During VATS, we discovered several diaphragmatic fenestrations that communicated with the abdominal cavity. Interestingly, your liver had herniated through these fenestrations. We resected the involved area and repaired the diaphragm using a nonabsorbable interrupted suture.
Patient: Oh, I didn't expect that. What did the pathologic report say?
Doctor: The pathologic report confirmed that you had diaphragmatic endometriosis. However, we managed to treat it effectively during the VATS procedure.
Patient: That's good to hear. What happened after the surgery?
Doctor: You underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) 4 months after the surgery, and I'm pleased to inform you that you became pregnant.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I came to your institution because I have this nevus on my left lumbosacral region. It's been there since I was born, but about a year ago, this new lesion appeared on top of it and has been growing rapidly.
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any other changes in the nevus, like color, edge irregularity, bleeding, or pain?
Patient: Yes, the lesion on top of the nevus has changed color, the edges are irregular, and it sometimes bleeds and causes pain.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. During the physical examination, I found a 6 x 4-cm erythematous tumor with active bleeding on top of an 8.5 x 3-cm dark brown plate. We also performed a total body photography and digital dermoscopy which documented more than 20 additional melanocytic lesions. We took a biopsy of the lumbosacral lesion, and the histopathological results showed a superficial spreading malignant epithelioid melanoma.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is. The fluorescence in situ hybridization results for the RREB1, MYB, and CCND1 genes, which are common molecular alterations in malignant melanomas, were positive for the new exophytic lesion and negative for the congenital nevus tissue. Based on these findings, we decided to proceed with treatment.
Patient: What kind of treatment did I undergo?
Doctor: You underwent a wide local excision, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and flap reconstruction. The pathological results indicated a Breslow's tumor thickness of 13 mm, Clark Level V, extensive ulceration, mitoses of 10/mm2, negative margins, and sentinel lymph nodes with extensive metastatic involvement. We also performed a lymphadenectomy and obtained 20 lymph nodes, six of which were positive.
Patient: So, what does this all mean for me?
Doctor: Based on these results, you have been diagnosed with stage IIID melanoma, or clinicopathologically T4bN3aM0, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 8th edition. The polymerase chain reaction test showed no BRAF mutations.
Patient: What's the next step for my treatment?

During the physical examination, I found a 6 x 4-cm erythematous tumor with active bleeding on top of an 8.5 x 3-cm dark brown plate. We also performed a total body photography and digital dermoscopy which documented more than 20 additional melanocytic lesions. We took a biopsy of the lumbosacral lesion, and the histopathological results showed a superficial spreading malignant epithelioid melanoma.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. The fluorescence in situ hybridization results for the RREB1, MYB, and CCND1 genes, which are common molecular alterations in malignant melanomas, were positive for the new exophytic lesion and negative for the congenital nevus tissue. Based on these findings, we decided to proceed with treatment.\nPatient: What kind of treatment did I undergo?\nDoctor: You underwent a wide local excision, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and flap reconstruction. The pathological results indicated a Breslow's tumor thickness of 13 mm, Clark Level V, extensive ulceration, mitoses of 10/mm2, negative margins, and sentinel lymph nodes with extensive metastatic involvement. We also performed a lymphadenectomy and obtained 20 lymph nodes, six of which were positive.\nPatient: So, what does this all mean for me?\nDoctor: Based on these results, you have been diagnosed with stage IIID melanoma, or clinicopathologically T4bN3aM0, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 8th edition. The polymerase chain reaction test showed no BRAF mutations.\nPatient: What's the next step for my treatment?\nDoctor: We started you on interferon-α-2b as an adjuvant treatment, but it caused toxicity during the first week of the induction phase. We will need to monitor your condition closely and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything to me. I appreciate your help and guidance during this difficult time.""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""S: The patient reports a rapidly growing lesion on top of a congenital nevus in the left lumbosacral region, present since birth but changed about a year ago.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that your 3.5-year-old daughter was referred to us due to her gait impairment and microcephalus. Can you tell me more about her current symptoms?
Parent: Yes, she recently had an episode where she seemed disconnected from the environment for a few seconds. She's also had isolated febrile convulsions and some sleep disorders in the past.
Doctor: I see. We performed an EEG during the episode, and the results were normal. However, it seems she recovered from the gait problems, but during pre-school, she experienced developmental delays, mainly motor-related. Is that correct?
Parent: Yes, that's right. And when she started school, she began having behavior problems similar to ADHD.
Doctor: We recommended psycho-pedagogic intervention and treatment with methylphenidate for her behavior issues. How has her school performance been since then?
Parent: Her school performance improved a little, but her sleep problems have gotten worse.
Doctor: I understand. We'll need to perform a new EEG to further investigate her sleep issues. In the meantime, we've conducted an MRI which showed a normally structured encephalon, but also confirmed the microcephalus.
Parent: What about the genetic study? Did you find anything related to her condition?
Doctor: Yes, the genetic study showed a 182 base deletion due to transcription problems in the C7 marker, specifically bases 2475-2657. However, we found no alterations in genes LIS1, PTAFR, PAFAH1B2, PAFAH1B3, FGF8, and PAX2.
Parent: What does this mean for her treatment and long-term prognosis?
Doctor: The genetic findings help us better understand her condition, but we'll need to continue monitoring her symptoms and adjusting her treatment as needed. The psycho-pedagogic intervention and medications may help with her behavior and developmental issues, but we'll need to address her sleep problems separately.
Parent: Okay, thank you for explaining everything. We'll keep an eye on her symptoms and follow up with you as needed.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any concerns or if her symptoms worsen, please don't hesitate to contact us. We're here to help.","S: The patient, a 3.5-year-old female, was referred for gait impairment and microcephalus.

The child also exhibits behavior problems similar to ADHD, which have slightly improved with psycho-pedagogic intervention and methylphenidate treatment, though sleep issues have worsened.
O: Physical examination previously confirmed microcephalus. An EEG performed during a disconnection episode was normal. An MRI showed a normally structured encephalon. Genetic testing revealed a 182 base deletion in the C7 marker (bases 2475-2657), with no alterations found in genes LIS1, PTAFR, PAFAH1B2, PAFAH1B3, FGF8, and PAX2.
A: The primary diagnosis is microcephalus with associated developmental and behavioral issues, including symptoms resembling ADHD. The genetic deletion may contribute to her clinical presentation, although key neurodevelopmental genes tested were normal. Differential diagnoses could include other genetic or metabolic disorders not yet identified. The prognosis is cautious, requiring ongoing monitoring and symptom management.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing blurred visual acuity and photopsias in one eye for the past few days.
Doctor: I see. Were there any symptoms before this visual issue started?
Patient: Yeah, about 2 days before my vision got blurry, I had flu-like symptoms like fever and headache.
Doctor: Okay, let's discuss your medical and ocular history. Have you had any previous issues or recent contact with animals, especially cats?
Patient: No, my medical history is unremarkable and I haven't been around any animals recently.
Doctor: Alright, we'll need to run some laboratory and imaging tests to determine the cause. Let's start with a complete blood count (CBC) and chest and sinus X-rays.
[After the tests]
Doctor: Your CBC results and X-rays came back normal. We also tested for syphilis, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Bartonella, Histoplasma capsulatum, Toxoplasma gondii, Toxocara canis, and Borrelia burgdorferi, and all results were negative. Now, let's perform an ocular examination.
[After the ocular examination]
Doctor: Your best-corrected visual acuity is 20/20 in your right eye and 20/25 in your left eye. Biomicroscopy of your anterior segment, pupillary reactions, and intraocular pressure are normal in both eyes. We took a color fundus photograph of your left eye, which revealed subtle deep retinal white spots in the posterior pole and around the optic disk.
Doctor: Fluorescein angiography (FA) demonstrated wreath-like punctate areas of early hyperfluorescence that corresponded to the deep white retinal lesions. Optic disc staining was observed in the late phase of FA. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) showed several hyperautofluorescent lesions topographically corresponding to the white lesions seen on the color fundus photograph.
Doctor: We also performed a cross-sectional optical coherence tomography (OCT) which showed disruption of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) at the same topography of the spots seen on both FAF and FA. Punctate hypereflective lesions and hyporeflective dots were observed in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and choroid, respectively.
Doctor: En-face OCT at the level of outer retina demonstrated multiple hyporeflective spots corresponding to the disruption of the EZ seen on the cross-sectional OCT. There was an absence of flow impairment in both the retinal and choroidal vasculature on OCT angiography (OCTA).
Doctor: Based on these findings, it seems that your visual symptoms are caused by an underlying issue with your retina. We'll need to monitor your condition closely and discuss possible treatment options.
Patient: Thank you for explaining all of this to me. What should I do for follow-up?
Doctor: I'd like to see you again in a few weeks to monitor your progress and reevaluate your condition. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, please contact our office immediately.
Patient: Okay, I appreciate your help. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment and reach out if anything changes.","S: The patient reports experiencing blurred visual acuity and photopsias in one eye for the past few days, preceded by flu-like symptoms including fever and headache.

After the procedure, these percentages remained the same. You then underwent a second ballooning and stenting procedure, after which revascularization was achieved. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: It's important to note that you have been attending a hypertension clinic and receiving antihypertensive drugs for the past 8 months on a regular basis under close observation. Despite this treatment and care, your blood pressure remained high at 175/110 mmHg. Your attending doctor concluded that this was uncontrolled blood pressure. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's what the doctors told me.
Doctor: Initial imaging indicated left renal artery stenosis, which is why you were referred to our department for further evaluation and treatment. Moving forward, it's crucial for you to continue with your medications and attend follow-up appointments so we can monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.
Patient: I understand, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient reports severe headaches and fatigue as symptoms leading to referral for a renal angiogram due to uncontrolled hypertension despite 8 months of antihypertensive medication. The patient denies any history of smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes, or atherosclerosis, and has no family history of these conditions.
O: Physical and neurological examinations were unremarkable, with the patient alert and oriented, and all motor and sensory functions normal. Laboratory tests showed normal complete blood count, cholesterol, lipid profile, and renal function with serum creatinine at 119 μmol/L. Renal Doppler ultrasound confirmed renal artery stenosis with a renal resistive index of 0.58. Imaging showed 70% and 75% stenosis in the branches of the left renal artery, which remained unchanged after the first balloon angioplasty but improved post-second procedure with stenting. Current blood pressure remains high at 175/110 mmHg.
A: The primary diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension secondary to bilateral renal artery stenosis, confirmed by imaging and Doppler studies. Differential diagnoses could include other secondary causes of hypertension, but these are less likely given the imaging results and lack of relevant personal or family history.
P: The patient will continue with current antihypertensive medications and is advised to maintain regular follow-up appointments in the hypertension clinic for monitoring and adjustment of the treatment plan as necessary.

"Doctor: Hi, I'm Dr. Smith. It seems that you, your mother, and your sibling have presented with some abnormal fusions of joints. Can you describe the issues with your hands and feet?
Patient: Sure, doc. On my fingers, both my thumbs are normal, but my other fingers lack creases on the flexor and extensor surfaces of the interphalangeal joints. I also can't flex those fingers.
Doctor: I see. How about your elbow joints? Are you able to move them normally?
Patient: Yes, I can move my elbows just fine. I can even touch my shoulder with my hands.
Doctor: Good to know. Now, let's talk about your feet. Have you noticed any abnormalities there?
Patient: Yeah, my feet have issues similar to my fingers. My big toes are normal, but the other toes lack creases on the flexor and extensor surfaces of interphalangeal joints, and I can't flex them. Also, the second toes on both feet are a little short.
Doctor: Okay. Since you're a gravida at 11 weeks of gestation, we won't perform X-ray examinations on you. However, we can look at the results from your mother and sibling for more information. 
Patient: That sounds reasonable.
Doctor: Your mother, patient I-2, had similar symptoms as you. The examination revealed that she had proximal interphalangeal joint osseous fusion in her left fingers 4-5 and right fingers 4-5, but no tarsal-carpal coalition was found. Foot radiographs showed that she had proximal interphalangeal joint osseous fusion in her left toes 3-5 and right toes 2-4. She also had bilateral talonavicular coalition and talocalcaneal coalition.
Patient: And my sibling?
Doctor: Your sibling, patient II-1, also had similar symptoms and normal elbows like you and your mother. We can assume that their X-ray examinations would show similar results to your mother's.
Patient: So, what does all of this mean for me and my family?
Doctor: It means that you and your family have a rare condition that affects the joints in your hands and feet. We'll need to monitor your situation and provide appropriate treatments or therapies to help you manage the symptoms.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. What should we do for follow-up?
Doctor: I'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to check on your progress. In the meantime, if you notice any changes or worsening of symptoms, please contact me immediately.
Patient: Alright, thank you, Dr. Smith.
Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment.","S: The patient reports inability to flex fingers except for the thumbs, which are normal. Similar issues are noted in the toes, with the big toes being normal but other toes lacking creases and flexibility. The second toes on both feet are described as slightly short. The patient's elbows function normally, allowing her to touch her shoulders with her hands. The patient is currently 11 weeks pregnant.
O: The patient's mother (patient I-2) exhibits proximal interphalangeal joint osseous fusion in fingers and toes, with additional bilateral talonavicular and talocalcaneal coalitions as per radiographic findings. It is assumed the patient's sibling (patient II-1) has similar radiographic findings given the similarity in symptoms and normal elbow function.
A: The patient, along with her mother and sibling, likely has a genetic or congenital condition leading to osseous fusion of certain joints in the hands and feet, with normal elbow function. Differential diagnosis could include various forms of arthrogryposis or syndromic presentations involving joint fusion. The prognosis depends on the extent of joint involvement and the progression of the condition.
P: Due to the patient's pregnancy, X-rays are contraindicated; however, monitoring through non-radiative means is advised. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in a few weeks to assess any progression or new symptoms. The patient is advised to report any worsening of symptoms immediately.

"Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. How can I help you today?
Patient's Mother: Hi, Doctor. This is my 5-year-old son. He was born at full term, but he had a history of hypoxia after birth. Recently, he's been having developmental delays and trouble sleeping.
Doctor: I see. Let's start by discussing the tests he's had so far. I understand he had a urinary organic acid analysis done. Do you remember the results?
Patient's Mother: Yes, the results showed a high level of GHB.
Doctor: Hmm, that's concerning. Has he had any other tests done, such as an EEG or a cerebral MRI?
Patient's Mother: Yes, both were done at other hospitals, but the results were unclear.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for that information. We conducted a genetic analysis on your son and found a novel homozygous mutation of c.800 T > G (p.V267G) in exon 5, which he inherited from both you and his father. Have you heard of this mutation before?
Patient's Mother: No, we haven't. What does it mean?
Doctor: Our bioinformatics analysis revealed that the specific protein, p.V267, is highly conserved among species. The mutation is predicted to be ""probably damaging"" and ""disease causing"" with a score of approximately equal to 1.
Patient's Mother: Oh no, that sounds serious. What does this mean for my son's development and health?
Doctor: This mutation could be a contributing factor to his developmental delay and sleep issues. We will need to monitor his progress closely and provide appropriate interventions to help him cope with these challenges.
Patient's Mother: What kind of interventions can we expect?
Doctor: We may consider therapies like occupational therapy, speech therapy, and behavioral therapy to address his developmental delays. Additionally, we'll work on improving his sleep hygiene and might consider medication if necessary.
Patient's Mother: Thank you, Doctor. What are the next steps we need to take?
Doctor: We will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your son's progress and adjust interventions as needed. It's important to keep an open line of communication with us to ensure the best possible care for your son.
Patient's Mother: We will definitely do that. Thank you so much for your help, Doctor.","S: The patient is a 5-year-old male with a history of hypoxia at birth, presenting with developmental delays and sleep disturbances.

How can I help you today?\nPatient\'s Mother: Hi, Doctor. This is my 5-year-old son. He was born at full term, but he had a history of hypoxia after birth. Recently, he\'s been having developmental delays and trouble sleeping.\nDoctor: I see. Let\'s start by discussing the tests he\'s had so far. I understand he had a urinary organic acid analysis done. Do you remember the results?\nPatient\'s Mother: Yes, the results showed a high level of GHB.\nDoctor: Hmm, that\'s concerning. Has he had any other tests done, such as an EEG or a cerebral MRI?\nPatient\'s Mother: Yes, both were done at other hospitals, but the results were unclear.\nDoctor: Okay, thank you for that information. We conducted a genetic analysis on your son and found a novel homozygous mutation of c.800 T > G (p.V267G) in exon 5, which he inherited from both you and his father. Have you heard of this mutation before?\nPatient\'s Mother: No, we haven\'t. What does it mean?\nDoctor: Our bioinformatics analysis revealed that the specific protein, p.V267, is highly conserved among species. The mutation is predicted to be ""probably damaging"" and ""disease causing"" with a score of approximately equal to 1.\nPatient\'s Mother: Oh no, that sounds serious. What does this mean for my son\'s development and health?\nDoctor: This mutation could be a contributing factor to his developmental delay and sleep issues. We will need to monitor his progress closely and provide appropriate interventions to help him cope with these challenges.\nPatient\'s Mother: What kind of interventions can we expect?\nDoctor: We may consider therapies like occupational therapy, speech therapy, and behavioral therapy to address his developmental delays. Additionally, we\'ll work on improving his sleep hygiene and might consider medication if necessary.\nPatient\'s Mother: Thank you, Doctor. What are the next steps we need to take?\nDoctor: We will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your son\'s progress and adjust interventions as needed. It\'s important to keep an open line of communication with us to ensure the best possible care for your son.\nPatient\'s Mother: We will definitely do that.

"Doctor: Good morning, I'm Dr. Smith. Can you tell me about your medical history?
Patient: Yes, I have poorly controlled diabetes.
Doctor: I see. What brings you to the emergency room today?
Patient: I was transported here because I started vomiting blood and felt disoriented.
Doctor: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you experienced any other symptoms lately?
Patient: Yeah, I've had nausea and epigastralgia for the past 2 days.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We'll need to run some tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. We've conducted a few tests and found that your general status was in shock, with concerning vital signs. Unfortunately, you didn't respond well to rehydration.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is quite concerning. Your laboratory findings showed a blood glucose level of 470 mg/dL and an arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.2, PCO2 of 25.2 mmHg, HCO3 of 9.9 mEq/L, and PO2 of 169 mmHg with an anion gap of 24.3 mEq/L. We also found positive urinary ketones and glucose.
Patient: What does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: These findings are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis. To further investigate, we performed an intubation and an emergency endoscopy. We observed black pigmentation in your entire esophageal mucosa.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We also did a CT scan, which revealed circumferential edematous thickening of your esophageal wall with slight pleural effusion. However, there was no obvious sign of perforation or free air in the mediastinum. Based on these findings, we diagnosed you with acute esophageal necrosis (AEN).
Patient: What's the treatment plan, doctor?
Doctor: We started you on antibiotics, glycemic control, a proton pump inhibitor, and plasmapheresis. You gradually stabilized and were extubated on day 5. However, you still had a fever, and the chest X-ray showed the accumulation of pleural effusion.
Patient: What happened next?
Doctor: On day 7, we suspected esophageal perforation due to the significant increase of the right pleural effusion and free air in the mediastinum on a CT scan. We performed an emergency thoracoscopy in a left semiprone position with differential lung ventilation and artificial pneumothorax.
Patient: That sounds intense.
Doctor: Yes, it was a necessary procedure. We observed significant pleural effusion with pus and perforation of the esophagus. We resected the transmural necrotic thoracic esophagus and placed drainage tubes at the anterior side of the thoracic cavity, at the posterior mediastinum, and above the diaphragm.
Patient: What's the next step in my recovery?
Doctor: We'll continue to monitor your condition closely and ensure that you receive the appropriate care and treatment moving forward. We'll also work closely with you to improve your diabetes management to prevent complications like this in the future.","S: The patient, with a history of poorly controlled diabetes, presented to the emergency room with vomiting blood and disorientation. He also reported experiencing nausea and epigastralgia for the past 2 days.
O: Upon examination, the patient was in shock with concerning vital signs and did not respond well to rehydration. Laboratory findings indicated a blood glucose level of 470 mg/dL, arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.2, PCO2 of 25.2 mmHg, HCO3 of 9.9 mEq/L, PO2 of 169 mmHg, and an anion gap of 24.3 mEq/L, along with positive urinary ketones and glucose. Intubation and emergency endoscopy revealed black pigmentation across the entire esophageal mucosa. CT scans showed circumferential edematous thickening of the esophageal wall and slight pleural effusion, but no signs of perforation or free air in the mediastinum initially. On day 7, a CT scan indicated a significant increase in right pleural effusion and free air in the mediastinum, suggesting esophageal perforation.
A: The primary diagnosis is acute esophageal necrosis (AEN) complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient's condition was further complicated by suspected esophageal perforation, as evidenced by the increase in pleural effusion and the presence of free air in the mediastinum.
P: The patient was treated with antibiotics, glycemic control measures, a proton pump inhibitor, and plasmapheresis, leading to initial stabilization. Following the diagnosis of esophageal perforation, an emergency thoracoscopy was performed, and the necrotic portion of the esophagus was resected. Drainage tubes were placed in the thoracic cavity and mediastinum. The patient will continue to be closely monitored, and diabetes management will be emphasized to prevent future complications.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're a 79-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, valvular heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Your baseline creatinine level is more than 300 μmol/L. Can you tell me about the symptoms you've been experiencing?
Patient: Yes, I've been having pain in my lower back and I think it's because of my kidney stones.
Doctor: That's correct. You presented with bilateral symptomatic large renal stones, and underwent staged stone treatment. Prior to coming to our hospital, you had bilateral double J stent (DJS) insertion, left extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, and FURS and laser stone fragmentation for the left renal stones. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. But I didn't get much relief, so I came here for further advice.
Doctor: I see. We conducted a non-contrast CT scan, which showed multiple bilateral renal stones. In your left kidney, there were 3 stones distributed to middle and lower pole calyces with a stone burden of approximately 3.0 cm. In your right kidney, there were also three stones: two in middle calyces and one in the pelvis, with a total stone burden of 3.2 cm. We then advised you to stop taking aspirin for seven days before undergoing the next treatment. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, I followed your advice and stopped taking aspirin.
Doctor: Great. After that, you underwent simultaneous bilateral FURS and holmium laser lithotripsy, and insertion of bilateral DJS under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The surgical procedure took 125 minutes - 65 minutes for the left side followed by 60 minutes for the right one. We used a similar procedure for both sides. Are you following so far?
Patient: Yes, I remember the surgery.
Doctor: During the procedure, we inserted a hydrophilic tip guidewire (Sensor, 0.038 in) and a ureteral access sheath (Inner diameter: 12 Fr, Length: 55 cm). The tip was located approximately at the level of the ureteropelvic junction. We used a Karl Storz flexible ureterorenoscope (8.5 Fr) for the surgery. Do you have any questions about the instruments used?
Patient: No, I think I understand.
Doctor: Good. During the procedure, we allowed normal saline to run from the bag, which was approximately 80 cm above the level of your pelvis, without a pump. We observed the outflow of saline from around the scope throughout the procedure. We used laser energy between 1.0–1.2 joules with a frequency ranging between 8 and 12 Hz (short pulses) in both sides. 4200 and 4066 pulses were used in the left and right sides, respectively.
Patient: Okay, I see.
Doctor: It's important to monitor your recovery and ensure that the kidney stones have been effectively treated. We'll need to schedule follow-up appointments to check on your progress. If you experience any discomfort or additional symptoms, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to follow up as needed.","S: The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, valvular heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and stage 4 chronic kidney disease, presenting with lower back pain.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're an 85-year-old woman with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) and have been admitted to undergo transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
Patient: Yes, I had a history of cerebral infarction, but no remarkable family history.
Doctor: Have you been experiencing any recent symptoms?
Patient: I've been having chest pain, clammy sweat, and anorexia lately. I visited a local doctor for AS treatment.
Doctor: I understand. After the preoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), did you experience any new symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I developed chest and back pain and even had a fever.
Doctor: It seems that the symptoms did not improve, and the computed tomography (CT) revealed prominent mediastinal emphysema and pleural effusion. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy confirmed esophageal perforation located 30 cm from the incisors, and gastrografin contrast revealed mediastinum leakage.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What's the diagnosis?
Doctor: You've been diagnosed with thoracic esophageal perforation. Because of your age and severe AS, radical thoracotomy surgery for primary repair or resection would be difficult. Instead, we will perform a two-stage surgery and indirect approach, which includes cervical esophagostomy to avoid contamination, gastrostomy for decompression, and jejunostomy for nutrition. Reconstruction will be planned after the mediastinitis and perforation are healed.
Patient: Alright, what's next?
Doctor: We performed an emergency operation 32 hours after the TEE under general anesthesia. A 12-mm trocar for the laparoscope was placed through the umbilicus, and four 5-mm ports were placed in the left upper, right upper, left middle, and right middle quadrants. We washed the contaminated mediastinum with saline through the esophageal hiatus from the abdominal cavity side and placed a drainage tube in the mediastinum. Then, we performed gastrostomy and jejunostomy laparoscopically, followed by cervical esophagostomy using a tube. Esophageal dissection was performed by an autosuture device.
Patient: How did the operation go?
Doctor: The operation was successful, with an operation time of 2 hours and 14 minutes and minimal blood loss.
Patient: That's good to hear. How's my recovery?
Doctor: Your postoperative clinical course has been good. At 11 days postoperatively, a CT revealed almost complete resolution of the mediastinal air and cavity, and the mediastinal drain was removed.
Patient: What's the next step in my treatment?
Doctor: At 22 days postoperatively, we performed an endoscopic retrograde observation via gastrostomy and found that the perforation had healed. We will continue to monitor your progress and plan for reconstruction when the mediastinitis and perforation are fully healed.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate the care and attention to my condition.","S: The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of severe aortic valve stenosis and cerebral infarction, presenting with recent symptoms of chest pain, clammy sweat, anorexia, and post-procedural chest and back pain with fever.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing some pain and swelling in my right breast, along with nipple retraction.
Doctor: I see. We should perform a breast ultrasonography (US) to get a better understanding of the issue. 
Patient: Alright.
(After the US)
Doctor: The US showed an irregular hypoechoic mass (30 × 10 mm) in your right retro-areolar space and a further lesion (maximum diameter 8 mm) in the right upper inner quadrant. There are also lymph nodes with a maximum diameter of 25 mm detected in your right axilla. We'll need to perform a core needle biopsy to determine the nature of these masses.
Patient: Okay, let's do it.
(After the biopsy)
Doctor: The biopsy results show that you have a poorly differentiated (G3) invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) that is estrogen receptor (ER) positive (65%) and progesterone receptor (PgR) positive (50%). The cell proliferation antigen (Ki-67) is 70%, and it's human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2 neu) negative.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that the cancer is aggressive and hormone-driven. We'll need to perform a total body Computed Tomography (CT) scan to check for metastatic disease.
(After the CT scan)
Doctor: Good news, the CT scan shows no evidence of metastatic disease. We'll start with four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using epirubicin 100 mg/m2 and taxol 175 mg/m2 every 21 days. After that, we'll perform a right ""skin sparing"" mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
(After the surgery and immunohistochemistry)
Doctor: The immunohistochemistry confirmed G3 luminal B/HER-2 neu negative IDC subtype. Eleven out of fifteen axillary lymph nodes showed metastatic deposits (TNM: pT4b N3a M0). We'll proceed with chest wall radiotherapy, including the supra−/infraclavicular lymphatic drainage area, followed by eight cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with taxol 175 mg/m2 every 21 days.
Patient: What about medications?
Doctor: You'll be taking Tamoxifen 20 mg daily and triptorelin 3.75 mg once a month for 3 years, followed by letrozole 2.5 mg daily for the next 3 years.
Patient: Got it.
(Seven years later)
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing diplopia, blurred vision, and significantly restricted upward right eye movements. My ocular acuity has decreased from 7 to 2/10 in both eyes.
Doctor: We should perform a brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to investigate the cause.
(After the MRI)
Doctor: The MRI showed a lump involving your right inferior rectus. We'll need to discuss further treatment options based on this new development.","S: The patient, a female, reports experiencing pain, swelling, and nipple retraction in her right breast. She also describes recent symptoms of diplopia, blurred vision, and significantly restricted upward right eye movements, with a decrease in ocular acuity from 7 to 2/10 in both eyes.
O: Initial breast ultrasonography revealed an irregular hypoechoic mass (30 × 10 mm) in the right retro-areolar space and another lesion (8 mm) in the right upper inner quadrant, with enlarged lymph nodes (25 mm) in the right axilla. Core needle biopsy confirmed poorly differentiated (G3) invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), ER positive (65%), PgR positive (50%), Ki-67 at 70%, and HER-2 neu negative. Total body CT scan showed no metastatic disease. Post-treatment immunohistochemistry confirmed G3 luminal B/HER-2 neu negative IDC, with 11 out of 15 axillary lymph nodes showing metastatic deposits (TNM: pT4b N3a M0). Recent brain MRI indicated a lump involving the right inferior rectus.
A: The primary diagnosis is poorly differentiated G3 luminal B/HER-2 neu negative IDC of the right breast, currently without distant metastasis but with significant local and regional spread. The new ocular symptoms and MRI findings suggest possible metastasis or a secondary malignancy involving the right inferior rectus.
P: The patient has completed four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (epirubicin and taxol), right skin-sparing mastectomy, axillary lymph node dissection, and chest wall radiotherapy. She is currently on hormonal therapy with Tamoxifen and triptorelin, to be followed by letrozole.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've been referred here for an evaluation of an abnormal murmur. Can you tell me about the symptoms you've been experiencing recently?
Patient: Yes, for the past 3 months, I've been having worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea.
Doctor: Alright, thank you for sharing that. During your physical examination, I noticed a soft continuous murmur at your left upper chest and basal crackles in both lungs. We conducted a chest radiography which showed mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary congestion. Your ECG showed regular sinus rhythm without evidence of ischemia or prior myocardial infarction.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We also performed a transthoracic echocardiography which demonstrated a mildly dilated LV with a markedly dilated left atrium. Your LV ejection fraction was 60% with no wall motion abnormality. There was an unusual, tubular-like structure inside the interventricular septum with a turbulent, predominantly diastolic flow on color Doppler.
Patient: Oh, that sounds concerning.
Doctor: Yes, it's quite unusual. We performed a transesophageal echocardiography which revealed a markedly dilated RCA arising from the right aortic sinus, while the origin of the left coronary artery (LCA) could not be demonstrated. There was a tortuous, abnormal vessel located adjacent to the main pulmonary artery (MPA) emptying into the posteromedial aspect of the MPA.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: We further observed an accelerated, continuous flow across the stenotic ostium. There was also severe MR from a restricted posterior leaflet of the mitral valve (MV) associated with ventricular remodeling in combination with mitral annular dilatation.
Patient: That sounds serious.
Doctor: To investigate further, we conducted coronary angiography with a single RCA injection. It revealed a markedly dilated RCA providing multiple intercoronary collaterals of various sizes communicating with the left coronary system. The LCA later opacified the MPA through a stenotic ostium, which established the diagnostic hallmark of ALCAPA syndrome.
Patient: ALCAPA syndrome? What is that?
Doctor: ALCAPA syndrome is a rare congenital heart condition. We confirmed a significant left-to-right shunt with a calculated ratio of pulmonary-systemic blood flow of 1.4. Additionally, coronary computed tomography angiography clearly identified the ALCAPA with a retropulmonary ostium.
Patient: What are the next steps?
Doctor: We will discuss your case with our team and determine the best course of treatment for you. We will inform you and your family of our recommendations and answer any questions you may have.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thorough evaluation and explanation.","S: The patient reports experiencing worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea over the past 3 months.

Coronary angiography confirmed ALCAPA syndrome with a left-to-right shunt, pulmonary-systemic blood flow ratio of 1.4, and coronary computed tomography angiography identified the ALCAPA with a retropulmonary ostium.
A: The primary diagnosis is ALCAPA syndrome, a rare congenital heart defect characterized by an abnormal origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, confirmed by imaging and hemodynamic studies. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of continuous murmur and cardiomegaly, but these were ruled out by specific imaging findings.

Coronary angiography confirmed ALCAPA syndrome with a left-to-right shunt, pulmonary-systemic blood flow ratio of 1.4, and coronary computed tomography angiography identified the ALCAPA with a retropulmonary ostium.\nA: The primary diagnosis is ALCAPA syndrome, a rare congenital heart defect characterized by an abnormal origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, confirmed by imaging and hemodynamic studies. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of continuous murmur and cardiomegaly, but these were ruled out by specific imaging findings.\nP: The management plan will involve multidisciplinary team discussion to determine the optimal surgical intervention to correct the coronary anomaly. The patient and family will be thoroughly informed about the condition, treatment options, and potential complications. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's response to treatment and manage any complications from the surgery. Education regarding the nature of the disease, signs of potential complications, and lifestyle adjustments will be provided to ensure compliance and improve prognosis.""}]",Evaluation and Management of ALCAPA Syndrome in a Patient with Cardiac Symptoms.
"Doctor: Hello, I see you were referred to our hospital due to swelling and pain on the left side of your neck for the past month. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yes, I've had this swelling on my neck, and it's been really painful. About a week ago, I was admitted to a local hospital because I had a low-grade fever, difficulty swallowing, and hoarseness.
Doctor: I see. At the local hospital, they treated you with intravenous ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a presumptive diagnosis of deep neck infection. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Do you have any medical history we should be aware of?
Patient: I have hypertension and I've been treated with amlodipine 10 mg and enalapril 10 mg daily for that.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. Do you have any habits like smoking or drinking?
Patient: I've been a heavy alcohol drinker for 40 years, and I'm a smoker as well.
Doctor: Alright, let's discuss your current condition. Upon admission, your body weight was 52 kg and your body mass index was 19.7 kg/m2. Your vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 38.7 °C; blood pressure, 170/100 mmHg; pulse rate, 100 beats/min; and respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min. We also did a physical examination. We found mild pale conjunctivae and anicteric sclerae. 
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: The neck exam revealed a pulsatile left neck mass, 5 x 5 cm in diameter, with mild tenderness on palpation, and no sign of inflammation. Your neck movement was not limited. The oropharyngeal exam showed bulging of the left posterior pharyngeal wall and tonsil enlargement, causing narrowing of your upper airway. Your thyroid gland was not enlarged, and the neurological exam was normal.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: We also performed a skin exam, which revealed multiple ill-defined scaly mild erythematous patches on both legs and dystrophic nails. 
Patient: Hmm, yes, I've noticed those patches.
Doctor: Your initial laboratory results showed anemia, with a hemoglobin concentration of 9.6 g/L and hematocrit of 28%. The MCV was 75 fl, and white blood cell count was 6800 cells/mm3, with 80% neutrophils and 7.7% lymphocytes. Your platelet count was 574,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin typing was normal.
Patient: That's a lot of information. What does it all mean for me?
Doctor: These results suggest that you have an ongoing infection, which we will continue to monitor and treat. It's important to manage your hypertension, and I recommend that you try to quit smoking and reduce your alcohol intake, as these habits can worsen your overall health. We will continue to evaluate your condition and provide appropriate treatment as needed. Please follow up with us regularly and let us know if you experience any changes in your symptoms.
Patient: Alright, I understand. Thank you, doctor.","S: The patient, a long-term smoker and heavy alcohol drinker, presents with a one-month history of painful swelling on the left side of the neck, accompanied by a low-grade fever, difficulty swallowing, and hoarseness that started approximately one week ago. The patient has a history of hypertension treated with amlodipine 10 mg and enalapril 10 mg daily.
O: On examination, the patient's vital signs showed a fever of 38.7 °C, hypertension (170/100 mmHg), tachycardia (100 beats/min), and tachypnea (24 breaths/min). Physical findings included a pulsatile 5 x 5 cm left neck mass with mild tenderness, bulging of the left posterior pharyngeal wall, tonsil enlargement, and no signs of inflammation or thyroid enlargement. The patient also exhibited mild pale conjunctivae, anicteric sclerae, and multiple scaly erythematous patches with dystrophic nails on both legs. Laboratory results indicated anemia (hemoglobin 9.6 g/L, hematocrit 28%, MCV 75 fl), leukocytosis (WBC 6800 cells/mm3 with 80% neutrophils), and thrombocytosis (platelet count 574,000 cells/mm3).
A: The primary diagnosis is a deep neck infection, likely complicated by the patient's history of alcohol and tobacco use, which may contribute to poor vascular health and immune function. Differential diagnoses include other causes of neck swelling such as thyroid disorders or malignancies, though the current clinical findings favor an infectious process. The patient's anemia and skin changes may suggest a chronic disease or nutritional deficiency.
P: Continue treatment with intravenous antibiotics as previously initiated (ceftriaxone and clindamycin). Address hypertension management and monitor blood pressure closely. Advise the patient on the importance of smoking cessation and reducing alcohol intake. Schedule a follow-up for further evaluation of the neck mass and response to treatment. Refer to a hematologist for evaluation of anemia and a dermatologist for assessment of skin lesions.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've come to the Pediatric Dentistry department today. What seems to be the issue?
Parent: Hi doctor. My 5-year-old son has had multiple small swellings in his mouth for the past 3 months. They first appeared during a high fever and have gradually increased in size even after the fever subsided.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about his medical history, dental history, and family history?
Parent: Well, there's nothing significant in his medical, dental, or family history.
Doctor: Alright. Let's have a look at the swellings. *Doctor conducts an extraoral examination* There are no specific findings in the extraoral examination. *Doctor conducts an intraoral examination* I can see the presence of soft, sessile papules varying from 2-10 cm in dimension. There are two papules on the right and left side of the lower lip region, and one on the left ventral aspect of the tongue.
Doctor: Based on the history and clinical features, I'm considering a provisional diagnosis of focal epithelial hyperplasia. We will also need to rule out differential diagnoses such as squamous cell papilloma, condylomataacuminata, mucocele, and focal dermal hypoplasia (Goltz–Gorlin syndrome).
Parent: What should we do next, doctor?
Doctor: First, we'll need to complete a hematological examination before any procedure. This will help us ensure that all parameters are within normal limits.
Parent: Okay, doctor.
*After the examination*
Doctor: Good news, all the parameters are within normal limits. We can now proceed with the removal of the lesions under local anesthesia. We'll be using a diode soft tissue laser of 810 nm of 3-3.5W power for 3-60 seconds intermittently.
Parent: Alright, let's do it.
*After the procedure*
Doctor: The lesions have been successfully removed and the specimens have been sent for histopathology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evaluation.
Parent: What did the results show?
Doctor: The histopathology reports revealed benign parakeratotic hyperplastic mucosa with marked papillomatosis and acanthosis. Some of the cells showed isolated perinuclear vacuolization and the presence of occasional mitosoid cells. Importantly, there was no evidence of dysplasia or atypical features of Heck's disease.
Parent: So, what does that mean?
Doctor: The PCR analysis confirmed the presence of HPV subtype 32 as the cause of this condition. Based on the histopathology and PCR results, we can establish a final diagnosis as Heck's disease (focal epithelial hyperplasia).
Parent: How do we treat Heck's disease?
Doctor: Since the lesions have been removed, we will monitor your child's condition closely. If there are any further concerns or new lesions appear, please bring your child back for a follow-up evaluation.

Mother: She has been active since birth, sucking well, and she already passed meconium.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Can you tell me about your pregnancy and prenatal care?
Mother: I'm a 22-year-old Para 1 mother. I had a term pregnancy and went for two ANC visits. I was vaccinated according to the national schedule and had an uneventful pregnancy. I didn't have any medical illness and only took iron and folate prescribed during my ANC visits.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. Can you describe the onset of labor and the delivery process?
Mother: My labor started spontaneously, and my membrane ruptured intrapartum. I gave birth after 5 hours of labor at a local health center. My baby had a good APGAR score.
Doctor: It's great that your baby had a good APGAR score. The health care providers at the health center referred your baby to us with a diagnosis of spinal bifida, correct?
Mother: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: During our initial evaluation at HUCSH, we found that your baby was active and had normal vital signs and neonatal reflexes. The mass in her vagina is 4x4 cm, reducible digitally, and increases in size when she cries. There's no discharge or bleeding from it. We also noted the 4x4 cm defect at her lumbosacral region, which is mostly covered with skin, and her bilateral club foot deformity.
Mother: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We've done some investigations, including a complete blood count and checking the creatinine level, which was 0.4mg/dl. These tests came back normal.
Mother: That's a relief.
Doctor: Yes, it's good news. We'll continue to monitor your baby's condition and provide appropriate treatment as needed. It's important to follow up with us regularly to ensure her well-being.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Well, I've been experiencing some issues with my kidneys and heart for a long time.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your medical history?
Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with SLE when I was 13 years old, and I have had renal and heart failure since then.
Doctor: I understand. It looks like you've been treated with steroids, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and azathioprine for your lupus nephritis since childhood. How effective were these treatments?
Patient: They helped me achieve partial remission of nephrotic syndrome, and I stopped receiving immunosuppressive therapy in 2002.
Doctor: That's good to hear. I also see that you're HBV and HCV positive. Your SLE has also affected your circulatory system, causing coronary atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, and myocardial infarction at a young age. 
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: In 2007, your kidney function deteriorated with a serum creatinine concentration of 2.2 mg/dL and proteinuria of 2 g/day. The kidney biopsy showed active and sclerotic focal proliferative lupus nephritis. However, immunosuppressive therapy was not introduced due to active HCV replication. Over time, your kidney function has been deteriorating. 
Patient: Yeah, it's been getting worse.
Doctor: Despite cardiac intervention and PCI RCA, you developed severe post-infarction and dilated cardiomyopathy. In 2009, you had ICD implantation for primary prevention. On a lupus and secondary cardiomyopathic background, you also developed severe mitral valve (MV) and tricuspid valve (TV) regurgitation. 
Patient: That's right, it was a tough time for me.
Doctor: You then underwent mitral and tricuspid valve repair and left ventricle volume reduction surgery in 2014. However, it was complicated by low cardiac output syndrome, requiring intra-aortic balloon pump use. In the postoperative period, your kidney function deteriorated further, necessitating the initiation of renal replacement therapy. 
Patient: Yes, I've been on dialysis for 4 years now.
Doctor: While being on the active waiting list for kidney transplantation, your lupus has been in remission with complement splits within normal limits (C3–0.93 g/l, C4–0.4 g/l) and ANA negative. However, you still have persistent circulatory insufficiency with reduced stair-climbing capacity and elevated BNP (619 pg/ml, normal 0-100).
Patient: Yes, I can only climb one flight of stairs before getting exhausted.
Doctor: I see. Before considering renal transplantation, we need to assess your heart function. I would recommend a transthoracic echocardiography to get a better understanding of your current cardiac condition.
Patient: Okay, I understand. Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to help you and keep you informed throughout the process. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.","S: The patient, diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) at age 13, reports a long history of renal and heart complications. The patient achieved partial remission of nephrotic syndrome but has experienced progressive kidney function decline and severe cardiac issues, including coronary atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, post-infarction dilated cardiomyopathy, and severe mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. The patient has undergone multiple cardiac surgeries and is currently on dialysis, awaiting kidney transplantation. The patient reports reduced exercise tolerance, being able to climb only one flight of stairs before exhaustion.
O: Past treatments include steroids, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and azathioprine, with cessation in 2002. The patient is HBV and HCV positive. Last recorded serum creatinine was 2.2 mg/dL, and proteinuria was 2 g/day. Kidney biopsy indicated active and sclerotic focal proliferative lupus nephritis.

Current labs show complement levels within normal limits (C3–0.93 g/l, C4–0.4 g/l), ANA negative, and elevated BNP at 619 pg/ml (normal 0-100).
A: The primary diagnosis is advanced SLE with secondary complications including chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 on dialysis, post-infarction dilated cardiomyopathy, severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and chronic HBV and HCV infection. Differential diagnoses include other causes of cardiomyopathy and valve diseases. The prognosis is guarded due to multi-organ involvement and chronic infections.
P: Continue current management of CKD with dialysis and monitor for eligibility for kidney transplantation. Assess cardiac function via transthoracic echocardiography to evaluate current status and risks associated with potential kidney transplantation.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you underwent a Wertheim-Meigs radical hysterectomy as a surgical treatment for cervical carcinoma in 1986. How have you been feeling since then?
Patient: I've been struggling with my health for a long time now. My main medical problem has been constant diarrhea for 17 years.
Doctor: I see. I also noticed that you had a subtotal thyroidectomy in 2000. But let's focus on your diarrhea issue. Have you undergone any diagnostics to identify the cause of your diarrhea?
Patient: Yes, I had H2-breath tests with lactose, fructose, and sorbitol. They diagnosed me with lactose and fructose malabsorption. I also had a Helicobacter pylori eradication in 2013.
Doctor: It seems like you've been through a lot. Have you had any rectoscopies or colonoscopies done?
Patient: I've had several - in 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2016. They found a stenosis in my sigmoid colon, but there were never any histologic aspects of inflammatory bowel disease.
Doctor: That's correct. A computed tomography of your abdomen and pelvis also revealed a long-range concentric thickening of the rectal wall with blurred confinement and fluid imbibition of the perirectal fatty tissue. These endoscopic and radiologic findings, in combination with your clinical history, confirmed the diagnosis of chronic radiation colitis. 
Patient: That's what they told me. I've tried so many treatments to help with my symptoms, but nothing seems to work.
Doctor: I can see that you've gone through several conservative therapies, including various probiotics such as E. coli strain Nissle 1917, Bifidobacteria (B. bifidum MIMBb75), loperamide, metoclopramid, mesalazine, intestinal tea, psyllium, rice cures, and healing earth. Unfortunately, none of these therapeutic approaches led to a significant and sustained improvement in your symptoms.
Patient: Yeah, it's been really tough. My quality of life has suffered so much, and I can hardly leave my house because of the diarrhea.
Doctor: I understand how difficult this must be for you. I see that you've requested to undergo a fecal microbiota therapy to improve your intestinal dysbiosis and hopefully alleviate your symptoms. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, I'm really hoping that this therapy can help me. I'm willing to try anything at this point.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of acquired FX deficiency from Amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, PAF, metastatic lung adenocarcinoma on erlotinib, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Hi doctor, I'm feeling okay, but I've been experiencing some issues lately.
Doctor: What kind of issues? Any specific symptoms?
Patient: Well, back in 2013 I had some self-limiting epistaxis and easy bruising.
Doctor: I see. We had performed some laboratory tests when you presented those symptoms. Your abnormal coagulation profile showed a prothrombin time (PT) of 12.4 seconds, INR of 1.2, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 38 seconds. Your elevated alkaline phosphatase was at 160 U/L and creatinine at 1.16 mg/dL. You also had proteinuria with 882 mg/24 h. Do you remember the results of your abdominal ultrasound?
Patient: Yes, it demonstrated hepatomegaly with the right lobe measuring 21 cm in the craniocaudal dimension.
Doctor: Correct. And your serum and urine electrophoreses were remarkable for the presence of a paraprotein, immunoglobulin G-lambda. The abdominal fat pad biopsy was unrevealing, but your liver biopsy showed extensive amyloid deposition. Immunohistochemical staining of the liver tissue revealed the presence of lambda light chain. Do you remember the results of your bone marrow core biopsy?
Patient: I do. It had extensive amyloid deposition, was positive for Congo red staining with classical apple-green birefringence under polarized light, and the Fluorescence in situ hybridization assay was positive for lambda light chains.
Doctor: That's right. So, further work-up of the abnormal coagulation study revealed a decreased FX coagulation activity of 45% (reference 70%-150%). Screening for an inhibitor to FX was negative. This led us to diagnose you with acquired FX deficiency secondary to AL amyloidosis. Due to your recurrent lung adenocarcinoma, you were deemed a poor candidate for autologous stem cell transplantation, so we started you on melphalan and dexamethasone chemotherapy. How has that been going for you?
Patient: It's been going okay, but in 2015 I developed an episode of symptomatic PAF.
Doctor: I see. At that time, your coagulation profile showed a PT of 16.3 seconds, aPTT of 33 seconds, and FX activity of 34%. It's important to continue monitoring your condition and follow the treatment plan we have laid out for you. Make sure to inform us of any new symptoms or concerns that arise.
Patient: I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care and see you at your next routine follow-up appointment.","S: The patient, with a history of acquired FX deficiency from AL amyloidosis, PAF, metastatic lung adenocarcinoma on erlotinib, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, reports feeling okay but has experienced issues including self-limiting epistaxis and easy bruising in 2013. The patient recalls previous lab results and medical procedures.
O: Previous lab results indicated a PT of 12.4 seconds, INR of 1.2, aPTT of 38 seconds, alkaline phosphatase at 160 U/L, creatinine at 1.16 mg/dL, and proteinuria with 882 mg/24 h. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly with the right lobe measuring 21 cm. Serum and urine electrophoreses indicated the presence of immunoglobulin G-lambda. Liver biopsy revealed extensive amyloid deposition with lambda light chain presence. Bone marrow core biopsy showed extensive amyloid deposition, positive Congo red staining, and positive fluorescence in situ hybridization for lambda light chains. Decreased FX coagulation activity was noted at 45% with a reference range of 70%-150%. In 2015, coagulation profile showed PT of 16.3 seconds, aPTT of 33 seconds, and FX activity of 34%.
A: The primary diagnosis is acquired FX deficiency secondary to AL amyloidosis. The patient's history of recurrent lung adenocarcinoma and other comorbidities complicate the management. Differential diagnoses include other causes of abnormal coagulation unrelated to amyloidosis. The prognosis is guarded due to the complexity of the underlying conditions and the recurrent nature of the lung cancer.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of recurrent throat infections. Can you tell me about your recent symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've had a fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, and cough for the past 5 days.
Doctor: I see. It says here that you presented to Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital and were diagnosed with influenza infection by your primary care physician on the first day of your illness. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Your PCP prescribed oseltamivir, but you had to stop taking it on day 3 due to nausea and vomiting. How have you been feeling since then?
Patient: I've started to have abdominal and joint pain in my left knee, right ankle, and right elbow. I've been feeling lethargic and haven't been eating much. My urine has also been dark.
Doctor: Hmm, that's concerning. When you arrived at the emergency center, your vital signs were not good. You were febrile with a temperature of 39.4°C, hypotensive with a blood pressure of 78/47 mm Hg, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 33 per minute, and tachycardic with a heart rate of 160 per minute. We admitted you to the pediatric intensive care unit and started you on intravenous cefepime and vancomycin. 
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Can you tell me who you live with and if any of them have had similar symptoms?
Patient: I live with my mother and three siblings, but none of them have had any current or prior symptoms like mine.
Doctor: That's good to know. During your physical examination, we found that you are acutely ill but responsive. You have crusted lip lesions, cervical lymphadenopathy, nasal congestion, nonpurulent pharyngeal erythema, a systolic murmur, and hepatosplenomegaly. There were no signs of arthritis. 
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Your initial lab studies showed some concerning results. You have a normal white blood cell count of 11,600/mm3, but you also have thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 36,000/mm3, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, and hypoalbuminemia with an albumin level of 1.9 g/dL. Additionally, you have proteinuria, sterile pyuria, and elevated inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein at 182 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
Patient: What does all that mean?
Doctor: These findings indicate that your body is fighting an infection or inflammation, which is likely causing your symptoms.

"Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having slowly progressive difficulty in walking and climbing stairs since I was 35 years old.
Doctor: I see. Have any of your family members experienced similar issues or been diagnosed with neuromuscular disorders?
Patient: No, there's no familial occurrence of neuromuscular disorders or consanguinity that I know of.
Doctor: Okay, let's proceed with a neurological examination. I've noticed scapular, anterior, and posterior thigh muscle atrophy in your examination. We'll also assess your muscle strength using the British Medical Research Council (MRC) scale.
Patient: Hmm, alright.
Doctor: Your assessment revealed weakness of shoulder girdle muscles, with arm flexion and abduction possible against gravity until 90°, without scapular winging, inferior trapezius (2/5), arm extensors (2/5), elbow flexors (3/5), hip flexors (3/5), hip extensors (2/5), knee flexors and extensors (4/5), and dorsal foot extensors (4/5). We didn't find any cranial nerve involvement, joint contractures, or skeletal deformities.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: You also presented a waddling gait with an increased lumbar lordosis and were unable to get up from the floor. Your functional ability of upper limbs was 3 according to the Brooke scale, and your lower limb function was 3 according to the Vignos scale.
Patient: So, what does that mean for me?
Doctor: It means you're currently able to perform some tasks, but you may need assistance in the future, especially if your condition worsens. Your CK levels were slightly increased at 253 UI/l. EMG findings showed myopathic changes in all tested muscles with fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves.
Patient: And what about the muscle CT scan?
Doctor: The CT scan revealed moderate fatty changes in your bilateral quadriceps, hamstrings, and medial gastrocnemius. Your respiratory and cardiac functions were normal, which is a good sign.
Patient: That's a relief, but my symptoms have been getting worse over the years.
Doctor: I understand. It's important to monitor your condition as you've lost the ability to climb stairs at the age of 45. We performed a muscle biopsy from your left quadriceps when you were 38, and it displayed fibre size variability, a few central nuclei, scattered degenerative fibres, and a few cytochrome oxidase-negative fibres. The ragged red appearing fibres were rare.
Patient: So, what's the next step, Doctor?
Doctor: We'll continue to monitor your condition closely and may recommend physical therapy, assistive devices, or medications to help manage your symptoms. It's essential to keep in touch with your healthcare team and report any changes in your condition.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to do that.","S: The patient, a 45-year-old male, reports a progressive difficulty in walking and climbing stairs since age 35.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented to the emergency department due to urinary retention, weakness, and paresthesia of both lower limbs. Can you tell me a bit more about when these symptoms started?
Patient: Yes, about two weeks prior to coming here, I started to feel some tingling and weakness in my right lower limb. It came on slowly but then quickly got worse and spread to both of my legs.
Doctor: I see. And have you experienced any other symptoms, such as a rash?
Patient: Yes, actually, I had a zoster rash that appeared 10 days ago. It was on the right side of my body, around my lower back area.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Upon admission, we conducted a neurological exam and found severe weakness in your lower limbs with a medical research council (MRC) grade of 0/5, while your upper limbs had normal muscle strength. Your ankle and knee jerk reflexes were abolished bilaterally, and Babinski sign was found bilaterally as well. We also noticed decreased sensation to touch with a T2 sensitive level bilaterally, and diminished vibration, temperature, and pinprick sensations in your lower limbs. The rest of your neurological functions appeared unremarkable.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We also performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and found a hyperintense T2 lesion in your spinal cord, extending from T2 to T11. Gadolinium enhancement was observed on the T1 sequence at the level of T7-T8. No brain or optic nerve lesions were found.
Patient: What does that mean, exactly?
Doctor: It means there's an abnormality in your spinal cord that could be contributing to your symptoms. We also conducted laboratory tests and found elevated white blood cells (WBC = 14100, 72% PMN) and positive IgG VZV serology, which indicates a possible viral infection. Your IgM VZV serology was negative. We tested for other viral and bacterial infections such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, CMV, HSV, Lyme disease, and syphilis, but those were all negative. Your auto-immune and vitamin workup was unremarkable.
Patient: So, what's causing my symptoms then?
Doctor: We believe it might be related to the elevated VZV IgG found in your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. Your CSF showed lymphocytic pleocytosis (94 cells/uL) and elevated VZV IgG (0.88) with a high VZV IgG index (14). The other tests, including VDRL-TPHA, Wright, and gram tests, as well as bacterial cultures, were all negative.
Patient: What does that mean for me?
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, history, and test results, we suspect that your symptoms may be caused by a viral infection related to the Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV). We'll need to discuss the appropriate course of treatment and follow-up requirements to manage your condition.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient, a 45-year-old male, presented with chief complaints of urinary retention, bilateral lower limb weakness, and paresthesia, which began approximately two weeks ago.

We also conducted laboratory tests and found elevated white blood cells (WBC = 14100, 72% PMN) and positive IgG VZV serology, which indicates a possible viral infection. Your IgM VZV serology was negative. We tested for other viral and bacterial infections such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, CMV, HSV, Lyme disease, and syphilis, but those were all negative. Your auto-immune and vitamin workup was unremarkable.\nPatient: So, what's causing my symptoms then?\nDoctor: We believe it might be related to the elevated VZV IgG found in your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. Your CSF showed lymphocytic pleocytosis (94 cells/uL) and elevated VZV IgG (0.88) with a high VZV IgG index (14). The other tests, including VDRL-TPHA, Wright, and gram tests, as well as bacterial cultures, were all negative.\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms, history, and test results, we suspect that your symptoms may be caused by a viral infection related to the Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV). We'll need to discuss the appropriate course of treatment and follow-up requirements to manage your condition.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you are a 21-year-old gravida 1 para 0 patient. How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi doctor, I am here for a routine anatomy scan at 20 weeks.
Doctor: Alright, let's take a look. The scan shows a normal anatomy survey, including two umbilical arteries. Your past medical history seems unremarkable as well. 
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: At 26 weeks, your estimated fetal weight was 874 grams, which is the 27th percentile. At 29 weeks, it increased to 1306 grams, which is the 26th percentile. However, the ultrasound at 29 weeks revealed a single umbilical artery, which raises suspicion for a pathological process. Have you experienced any complications or unusual symptoms?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed anything unusual.
Doctor: We performed a fetal echocardiogram, and fortunately, it was normal. At 31 weeks, the estimated fetal weight was 1349 grams, which is less than the 5th percentile. The Doppler evaluation and biophysical profile were normal at that time.
Patient: Okay, but what does that mean for my baby?
Doctor: At 32 weeks, the amniotic fluid index was 10.1 cm, the biophysical profile was 10/10, but the cerebroplacental ratio decreased to 1.083. At 33 weeks, the amniotic fluid index decreased to 2.3 cm. Maternal and fetal Doppler evaluations were normal, except for an abnormal cerebroplacental ratio of 1.08. Fetal heart tracing showed spontaneous prolonged decelerations. 
Patient: That sounds concerning. What should we do?
Doctor: Secondary to the recurrent prolonged decelerations, we performed a primary cesarean delivery. Your baby, a live male infant, was delivered weighing 1395 grams with APGAR scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.
Patient: Oh, I'm relieved to hear that he was born safely.
Doctor: Yes, the delivery went well. However, the placental pathology showed thrombosis of one of the umbilical arteries with necrosis of the medial myocytes. It also showed subendothelial fibrin deposition in stem villous blood vessels, chorionic villous hypervascularity, and a small subchorionic placental infarct. 
Patient: Were there any signs related to thrombosis in my baby?
Doctor: At birth, your baby showed no signs related to thrombosis. Thrombophilia profiles revealed a severe protein S deficiency with an activity of 13%, but it resolved at two months of age with an activity of 66%. 
Patient: That's a relief. How has my baby been doing since then?
Doctor: The neonate has had an uneventful clinical course since birth. We will continue to monitor his progress, but everything seems to be going well.
Patient: Thank you so much, doctor. I appreciate all the information and care you've provided.
Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any concerns or questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.","S: The patient is a 21-year-old gravida 1 para 0 female at 33 weeks gestation, presenting for routine prenatal care. She reports no unusual symptoms or complications during the pregnancy. The patient's past medical history is unremarkable.
O: Initial anatomy scan at 20 weeks showed normal fetal anatomy including two umbilical arteries. Subsequent ultrasounds at 26 and 29 weeks showed fetal weights in the 27th and 26th percentiles, respectively. At 29 weeks, a single umbilical artery was noted. Fetal echocardiogram was normal. At 31 weeks, fetal weight was below the 5th percentile. Doppler evaluation and biophysical profile were normal. At 32 weeks, amniotic fluid index was 10.1 cm and biophysical profile was 10/10, but cerebroplacental ratio decreased to 1.083.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I have this mass on my sacrum since August 2015. I have a learning disability, but no significant past medical history.
Doctor: How has the mass been changing since you first noticed it?
Patient: It has been increasing in size and it's painless.
Doctor: I see. Have you sought any medical treatment for this mass?
Patient's Mother: We initially took her to a traditional healer, but we didn't seek any medical treatment until late 2017.
Doctor: Can you describe how the mass has affected your daily life?
Patient: I haven't been able to ambulate for the past 2 years, so I've been bedbound most of the time. It's difficult for me to sit on a wheelchair, and I feel tired because the mass is heavy.
Doctor: What do you do to find a comfortable position when you're lying down or sleeping?
Patient: I usually sleep either in a prone position or in supine with multiple pillows below my body. When I lie down flat, I have to flex my hips and knees to be more comfortable.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. Can you tell me more about your family medical history?
Patient's Mother: There's no family history of cancer. She lives with me and her siblings. I am her main caretaker since her father passed away 10 years ago due to a heart attack. She used to attend a special needs school but stopped going in 2015 after the sacral mass developed.
Doctor: I understand. We will be managing your case at the Southern Region referral centre for Orthopaedic Oncology in Malaysia. During your clinical examination, we noticed that you appear cachexic and have slightly pale conjunctiva. Your vital signs are: Blood Pressure 142/90, Pulse Rate 98 beats per minute, and Temperature 37 degrees Celsius. The mass measures 40 cm × 30 cm. 
Patient: What does ""cachexic"" mean, doctor?
Doctor: Cachexic means that you appear to have lost a significant amount of weight and muscle. Your mother mentioned that your body has been getting thinner over the last 2 months, despite the increase in the size of the sacral mass.
Patient: Oh, I see. What are the next steps for my treatment?
Doctor: We will further investigate the mass and discuss the appropriate treatment options for you. You will be closely monitored and provided with the necessary care throughout the process.

"Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Johnson, and I'll be taking care of you today. I understand you've been experiencing altered mental status for about a week now, along with fever, neck pain, nausea, and vomiting. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right, doctor.
Doctor: As you were unable to provide your past medical history due to your altered mental state, I had a chat with your family. They mentioned that you haven't had any complaints of abdominal pain, headache, visual changes, focal weakness, chest pain, or dyspnea. Is there anything else you think I should know about your medical history?
Patient: Hmm, I can't think of anything else.
Doctor: Alright. Your family also mentioned that you've been waking up at night to cook and clean, and you've been intermittently somnolent. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs?
Patient: No, I don't smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs.
Doctor: Okay, and you were born in China and immigrated to the United States, where you've resided for the past 30 years without any foreign travel, correct? And you haven't seen a physician in your adult life and took no medications?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Due to the concern about the stability of your airway, you were intubated in the emergency department and admitted to the intensive care unit. Upon admission, your vital signs were as follows: temperature 36.5°C, heart rate 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, blood pressure 108/61 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on an FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) of 40%. 
Patient: Okay, got it.
Doctor: During your physical examination, we found a positive Brudzinski sign and neck stiffness, even while sedated. Your pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, and you responded to painful stimuli. Your lungs were clear upon auscultation, and your cardiac examination was unremarkable without any murmur. Your abdominal examination was normal, with no hepatomegaly or ascites.
Patient: Alright, thank you for the update.
Doctor: Your admission laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 19,900/mm3 (81% neutrophils), hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 170,000/µL, creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase 49 IU/L, alanine transaminase 81 IU/L, and alkaline phosphatase. These results will help guide our treatment plan for you.
Patient: I see. So, what are the next steps?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your vital signs and symptoms closely, and our team will develop a treatment plan based on your lab results and examination findings. We'll make sure to keep you and your family updated on your progress and any changes in your condition.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.

"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me a bit about your past medical history? I see that you have been diagnosed with a virus.
Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with HIV when I was two years old. I got it through vertical transmission.
Doctor: How have you been feeling recently?
Patient: I came to the emergency department because I've been having a worsening headache for the past 10 days. I also have blurry vision, photophobia, nausea and vomiting, and progressive memory lapses.
Doctor: I see. Have you been taking any antiretroviral medications for your HIV?
Patient: No, I haven't taken any for the past year. I don't know my last CD4 count either.
Doctor: Have you visited any other emergency departments before coming here?
Patient: Yeah, I went to two other EDs but I'm not sure about the timelines. They diagnosed me with sinusitis and discharged me with antibiotics.
Doctor: Did you have any fever, nuchal rigidity, or weight loss recently?
Patient: No, none of those.
Doctor: When you arrived at the ED, your initial temperature was 98.9°F, with a blood pressure of 94/79 mm Hg and a pulse rate of 79 beats/min. Your respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min with oxygen saturation at 100%. You didn't have any focal neurological deficits and you were alert and oriented. Your pupillary exam showed photophobia with equal and reactive 3 mm pupils bilaterally.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: We performed several blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), urinalysis, and a drugs of abuse screen. All results were within normal limits. An Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm and a chest plain radiograph was normal as well.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: We also did a non-contrast brain computed tomography (CT) which revealed no acute hemorrhage or lesion. However, upon reassessment in the ED, you developed a fever of 102°F and became more confused and agitated, with interspersed screaming and yelling.
Patient: Oh, I don't remember that.
Doctor: Due to the concern for encephalitis, we performed a lumbar puncture (LP) in the lateral decubitus position to analyze your cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and measure the opening pressure. Unfortunately, you were too agitated to safely obtain a reliable opening pressure.
Patient: What were the results from the LP?
Doctor: The results showed a cloudy appearing CSF, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 22. The normal range is 0-5. This indicates an infection, and we will need to start you on appropriate treatment.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. We will closely monitor your condition and adjust the treatment as necessary. Please make sure to follow up with us for further evaluation.","S: The patient, diagnosed with HIV through vertical transmission at age two, presents with a 10-day history of worsening headache, blurry vision, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, and progressive memory lapses. The patient has not taken antiretroviral medications for the past year and is unaware of their last CD4 count. Previous visits to other emergency departments resulted in a diagnosis of sinusitis, treated with antibiotics.

Patient: I've been experiencing upper abdominal pain, arthralgia, myalgia, hyporexia, malaise, and intermittent fever. I also noticed my skin turning yellow lately.
Doctor: I see, that sounds like progressive jaundice. Can you tell me about your medical history?
Patient: I have chronic heart failure (Stage C, NYHA III), no documented cardiac murmurs, right bundle branch block, non-valvular atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic venous disease.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Now let's conduct a physical examination. *After the examination* You were conscious during the examination, and I noticed tachycardia, tachypnea, mucocutaneous jaundice, venous neck pulsations with abdominojugular reflux, increased S1 intensity with irregular rhythm, and a systolic murmur at both upper sternal borders. Your breath sounds were also diminished at both lung bases. Your abdominal and neurological findings were unremarkable. However, I did feel a non-painful palpable liver 3 cm down the costal border at the mid-clavicular line.
Patient: Okay, what does all that mean?
Doctor: We'll need to perform some further tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. *After reviewing test results* Your hematological evaluation showed leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. The electrocardiographic evaluation showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and right bundle branch block, and the chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusion.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you're a 19-month-old boy born in March 2015 with multiple brown-black skin pigmentation on your face, trunk, and right leg, along with some satellite lesions. Is that correct?
Patient's Parent: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: You were referred to the hospital because of repeated vomiting for 4 days. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient's Parent: Yes, he's been vomiting quite frequently, and it's been concerning us.
Doctor: I see. Upon examination, I noticed that your child has a round face, full cheeks, prominent forehead, hypertelorism, periorbital fullness, short nose, and an everted lower lip. Have you noticed any other physical symptoms?
Patient's Parent: No, those are the main ones.
Doctor: We performed an Enhanced MRI, which showed hydrocephalus. To relieve the symptoms of intracranial hypertension, we performed a shunt surgery. After the surgery, we've been doing MRI and/or computed tomography (CT) assessments every 3 months. Have you noticed any improvements in his symptoms?
Patient's Parent: Yes, there has been some improvement.
Doctor: Six months post-shunt MRI revealed the presence of supratentorial ventricular dilatation, brain stem volume reduction, and leptomeningeal enhancement. However, no macroscopic mass was evident at that time. Three months later, another MRI showed a mass of 3 cm diameter in the right frontal lobe.
Patient's Parent: Oh, that's concerning.
Doctor: Yes, it is. We decided to move forward with surgery to remove the tumor. Although the tumor was completely resected, I'm sorry to inform you that your child passed away 4 months after the surgery.
Patient's Parent: It's heartbreaking, but we understand.
Doctor: The pathological evaluation of the CNS lesion revealed that the mass was grossly dark-red to brown and measured (4 × 4 × 2) cm. It was firmly attached to the meninges. Microscopically, the tumor cells had atypical nuclei, obvious nucleoli, an increased karyoplasmic ratio, some mitoses, and remarkable necrosis. They infiltrated the brain parenchyma and were accompanied by melanin deposition.
Patient's Parent: What were the results of the immunohistopathological evaluation?
Doctor: The tumor cells positively expressed the antibodies of HMB45, Melan-A, and S100. However, the Ki-67 was positively expressed in 30% of the cells, while P53 was negative.
Patient's Parent: And what about the cytogenetic study?
Doctor: The cytogenetic study using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a lack of allelic deletion of P53. ARMS-PCR disclosed an NRAS mutation in the third exon (codon 61).
Patient's Parent: Thank you for explaining all of this to us. We appreciate your help and guidance throughout this difficult time.","S: The patient, a 19-month-old boy born in March 2015, presented with multiple brown-black skin pigmentation on his face, trunk, and right leg, and satellite lesions. The chief complaint was repeated vomiting for 4 days. The parent reported frequent vomiting and noted the child's round face, full cheeks, prominent forehead, hypertelorism, periorbital fullness, short nose, and an everted lower lip as main physical symptoms.
O: Physical examination confirmed the described facial features. Enhanced MRI indicated hydrocephalus, leading to shunt surgery. Post-operative follow-up MRIs showed supratentorial ventricular dilatation, brain stem volume reduction, and leptomeningeal enhancement, with later identification of a 3 cm mass in the right frontal lobe. Pathological evaluation post-tumor resection revealed a dark-red to brown mass, 4x4x2 cm, attached to the meninges with atypical nuclei and melanin deposition. Immunohistopathological evaluation showed positive expression for HMB45, Melan-A, S100, and 30% Ki-67; P53 was negative. Cytogenetic study indicated no allelic deletion of P53 and an NRAS mutation in exon 3 (codon 61).
A: The primary diagnosis was a malignant melanocytic tumor of the CNS, with complications including hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension. Differential diagnosis initially considered could have included other types of brain tumors or metastatic lesions. The prognosis was poor, as indicated by the aggressive growth and fatal outcome despite surgical intervention.
P: The management included surgical intervention for both hydrocephalus (shunt surgery) and tumor resection. Regular MRI/CT assessments were scheduled every 3 months to monitor progression. Immunohistopathological and cytogenetic studies were conducted to further characterize the tumor. The patient unfortunately passed away 4 months post-tumor resection surgery.

Is that correct?\nPatient's Parent: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: You were referred to the hospital because of repeated vomiting for 4 days. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient's Parent: Yes, he's been vomiting quite frequently, and it's been concerning us.\nDoctor: I see. Upon examination, I noticed that your child has a round face, full cheeks, prominent forehead, hypertelorism, periorbital fullness, short nose, and an everted lower lip. Have you noticed any other physical symptoms?\nPatient's Parent: No, those are the main ones.\nDoctor: We performed an Enhanced MRI, which showed hydrocephalus. To relieve the symptoms of intracranial hypertension, we performed a shunt surgery. After the surgery, we've been doing MRI and/or computed tomography (CT) assessments every 3 months. Have you noticed any improvements in his symptoms?\nPatient's Parent: Yes, there has been some improvement.\nDoctor: Six months post-shunt MRI revealed the presence of supratentorial ventricular dilatation, brain stem volume reduction, and leptomeningeal enhancement. However, no macroscopic mass was evident at that time. Three months later, another MRI showed a mass of 3 cm diameter in the right frontal lobe.\nPatient's Parent: Oh, that's concerning.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. We decided to move forward with surgery to remove the tumor. Although the tumor was completely resected, I'm sorry to inform you that your child passed away 4 months after the surgery.\nPatient's Parent: It's heartbreaking, but we understand.\nDoctor: The pathological evaluation of the CNS lesion revealed that the mass was grossly dark-red to brown and measured (4 × 4 × 2) cm. It was firmly attached to the meninges. Microscopically, the tumor cells had atypical nuclei, obvious nucleoli, an increased karyoplasmic ratio, some mitoses, and remarkable necrosis. They infiltrated the brain parenchyma and were accompanied by melanin deposition.\nPatient's Parent: What were the results of the immunohistopathological evaluation?\nDoctor: The tumor cells positively expressed the antibodies of HMB45, Melan-A, and S100. However, the Ki-67 was positively expressed in 30% of the cells, while P53 was negative.\nPatient's Parent: And what about the cytogenetic study?\nDoctor: The cytogenetic study using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a lack of allelic deletion of P53. ARMS-PCR disclosed an NRAS mutation in the third exon (codon 61).\nPatient's Parent: Thank you for explaining all of this to us. We appreciate your help and guidance throughout this difficult time.""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""S: The patient, a 19-month-old boy born in March 2015, presented with multiple brown-black skin pigmentation on his face, trunk, and right leg, and satellite lesions.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 37-year-old male with Down syndrome and epilepsy, and you're currently taking carbamazepine. What brings you to the emergency room today?
Patient: Hi, doc. My tongue has become really large and it's sticking out of my mouth. It happened suddenly, about 30 minutes ago.
Doctor: I see. Are you feeling stable right now, or are you experiencing any agitation?
Patient: I'm a bit agitated, to be honest. It's quite uncomfortable.
Doctor: I understand. We'll consult the otolaryngology team immediately for further evaluation. Have you experienced anything like this before?
Family Member: Yes, actually. He has a history of engaging in aggressive behavior and has had multiple tongue tractions that led to sudden severe tongue swelling.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. Let's examine the tongue. Hmm, it seems to be swollen but without any hematoma. I'll also perform a flexible nasolaryngoscopy to check for any laryngeal edema. Good news, your vocal cords are moving normally, and there's no laryngeal edema.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: We'll also consult the neurology team to rule out an active seizure, since you have epilepsy. They've cleared you, so no seizure activity is noted.
Patient: Okay, that's good.
Doctor: Given the situation, we need to intubate you to secure your upper airway and admit you to the intensive care unit (ICU). We'll do an endotracheal intubation, and if that fails, we might need to perform a tracheostomy. Are you okay with that?
Patient: Yes, I understand. Please do what's necessary.
Doctor: Great, we've successfully performed the orotracheal intubation in the operating room. We also did a CT scan, which showed an enlarged, diffused edematous hypertrophic tongue muscle protruding outside the oral cavity and deviated to the left side due to tube insertion from the right side. There were no mass lesions, abnormal enhancement, or sizable lymphadenopathy.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: Now, we'll transfer you to the ICU while intubated and connect you to mechanical ventilation. We'll administer midazolam, fentanyl, and dexamethasone at 8 mg intravenously every 6 hours to relieve the swelling, as well as pantoprazole for 4 days.
Patient: Alright, thank you.
Doctor: To prevent tongue biting, we'll place a removable bite block on your teeth, and we'll also apply wet gauze to the exposed part of your tongue for your comfort.

O: Physical examination reveals significant tongue swelling without hematoma. Flexible nasolaryngoscopy shows normal vocal cord movement and no laryngeal edema. Neurological evaluation rules out active seizure activity. CT scan of the head shows an enlarged, diffusely edematous hypertrophic tongue muscle, deviated to the left side, with no mass lesions, abnormal enhancement, or significant lymphadenopathy.

The prognosis is cautiously optimistic with appropriate airway management and monitoring.
P: Immediate airway management was achieved through successful orotracheal intubation, with plans for tracheostomy if needed.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've been admitted to our hospital with symptoms of dysphagia. Can you tell me more about the issues you've been experiencing?
Patient: Yes, I've been having difficulty swallowing lately.
Doctor: I understand. We performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and found an elevated lesion 33-36 cm from an incisor tooth accompanied by ulcers at the center of the lesion. It's located in your lower thoracic esophagus (Fig. a). Additionally, we found another submucosal tumor at the anal site of the lower thoracic esophagus, which we believe is intramural metastasis.
Patient: Oh, that sounds concerning.
Doctor: Esophagography showed the main tumor lesion on the left antero-lateral wall of your lower esophagus and a submucosal tumor on the other side, causing constriction of the esophagus. The main lesion has good extension on its basal part, indicating that the depth of invasion is at the submucosal level (Fig. b).
Patient: Hmm, I see.
Doctor: We also did a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed the protruded tumor lesion to be 3 cm in size. Fortunately, there were no findings of lymph node or distant metastasis (Fig. c).
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: Moreover, a positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) scan showed an increased uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in the lower thoracic esophagus, but no findings of lymph metastasis (Fig. d).
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: We conducted a blood test to check for tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and squamous cell carcinoma associated antigen (SCC). The results showed that these markers were not elevated.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: A pathological examination of an endoscopic biopsy revealed that you have moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Based on these preoperative analyses, you've been diagnosed with cT2N0M0, cStageII esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Patient: Oh, that's unfortunate.
Doctor: Because you're elderly and have a poor performance status (PS 2), we decided not to proceed with preoperative therapy, postoperative therapy, or lymph node dissection of the superior to mid-mediastinum regions.
Patient: I understand.
Doctor: Instead, we performed thoracoscopy- and laparoscopy-assisted subtotal esophagectomy and reconstruction with the gastric tube. Under thoracoscopy and laparoscopy, we performed subtotal esophagectomy and lymphadenectomy, and reconstruction was performed through the retrosternal route.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: The total operation time was 377 minutes, and intraoperative blood loss was 105 ml.
Patient: That's not too bad.
Doctor: We started you on an oral diet 11 days after the operation, and you've been recovering since then.
Patient: Yes, I've been feeling better. Thank you for all your help, doctor.

"Doctor: Hello! How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been experiencing progressive gait difficulties, rigidity, and weakness in both of my legs since I was 35. I'm 37 now.
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I also have urinary urgency with incontinence and erectile dysfunction.
Doctor: Hmm. Does your family have any history of neurological or endocrinological diseases?
Patient: No, my family history is negative for those diseases.
Doctor: Alright. Did you have normal psychomotor development and no learning disabilities growing up?
Patient: Yes, that's right. I didn't report any cognitive symptoms either.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, we conducted a neurological examination. We found mild dysarthria, spastic paraparesis with a wide-based spastic gait. Your deep tendon reflexes were diffusely brisk with a bilateral Achilles clonus and Babinski sign.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We also conducted a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan which showed multiple congenital brain development defects, including posterior commissure agenesis, right fornix and ipsilateral mammillary body hypoplasia, colpocephaly, right frontal parasagittal cortical thickening, two periventricular nodular heterotopic foci in the right parietal areas, and two venous drainage abnormalities in the left cerebellar hemisphere and right frontal lobe.
Patient: That's a lot of abnormalities.
Doctor: Indeed. We also performed a neuropsychological evaluation, which fortunately revealed no abnormalities. Your electroencephalography (EEG) did not show any epileptiform discharges.
Patient: Okay, that's a bit of relief.
Doctor: Additionally, a spinal MRI showed spinal cord atrophy, but electromyography (EMG) did not reveal any abnormal findings.
Patient: What about other tests?
Doctor: Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) showed increased central conduction time from your right arm and left leg. However, no response was recorded from your right leg. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were absent in both legs, but visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and optic coherence tomography (OCT) were unremarkable.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: We used a multi-gene panel for hereditary spastic paraplegia and other motor neuron diseases to further investigate. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of the hemizygous mutation c.1394-2A > G in the ABCD1 gene, leading to the diagnosis of x-ALD.
Patient: So, what does that mean for me?
Doctor: It means you have a rare genetic disorder called x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (x-ALD). It affects the nervous system and adrenal glands. Your hematochemical examination disclosed normal cortisol levels with an increased adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH; 352 pg/mL, normal value 5–60 pg/mL), consistent with subclinical adrenocortical insufficiency.
Patient: What are the next steps?
Doctor: We will monitor your condition and provide supportive care to manage your symptoms. It is essential to have regular follow-ups with your neurologist and endocrinologist to monitor your hormone levels and neurological function.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.
Doctor: You're welcome. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

I've been experiencing progressive gait difficulties, rigidity, and weakness in both of my legs since I was 35. I'm 37 now.\nDoctor: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I also have urinary urgency with incontinence and erectile dysfunction.\nDoctor: Hmm. Does your family have any history of neurological or endocrinological diseases?\nPatient: No, my family history is negative for those diseases.\nDoctor: Alright. Did you have normal psychomotor development and no learning disabilities growing up?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I didn't report any cognitive symptoms either.\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms, we conducted a neurological examination. We found mild dysarthria, spastic paraparesis with a wide-based spastic gait. Your deep tendon reflexes were diffusely brisk with a bilateral Achilles clonus and Babinski sign.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We also conducted a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan which showed multiple congenital brain development defects, including posterior commissure agenesis, right fornix and ipsilateral mammillary body hypoplasia, colpocephaly, right frontal parasagittal cortical thickening, two periventricular nodular heterotopic foci in the right parietal areas, and two venous drainage abnormalities in the left cerebellar hemisphere and right frontal lobe.\nPatient: That's a lot of abnormalities.\nDoctor: Indeed. We also performed a neuropsychological evaluation, which fortunately revealed no abnormalities. Your electroencephalography (EEG) did not show any epileptiform discharges.\nPatient: Okay, that's a bit of relief.\nDoctor: Additionally, a spinal MRI showed spinal cord atrophy, but electromyography (EMG) did not reveal any abnormal findings.\nPatient: What about other tests?\nDoctor: Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) showed increased central conduction time from your right arm and left leg. However, no response was recorded from your right leg. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were absent in both legs, but visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and optic coherence tomography (OCT) were unremarkable.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: We used a multi-gene panel for hereditary spastic paraplegia and other motor neuron diseases to further investigate. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of the hemizygous mutation c.1394-2A > G in the ABCD1 gene, leading to the diagnosis of x-ALD.\nPatient: So, what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: It means you have a rare genetic disorder called x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (x-ALD). It affects the nervous system and adrenal glands. Your hematochemical examination disclosed normal cortisol levels with an increased adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH; 352 pg/mL, normal value 5–60 pg/mL), consistent with subclinical adrenocortical insufficiency.\nPatient: What are the next steps?\nDoctor: We will monitor your condition and provide supportive care to manage your symptoms. It is essential to have regular follow-ups with your neurologist and endocrinologist to monitor your hormone levels and neurological function.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

"Doctor: Hi there, I see that you were admitted to our hospital with a 4-day history of high fever and scalp swelling with ulcers. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been having a high fever and my scalp has been swelling up with these painful ulcers.
Doctor: I understand. We conducted a physical examination and found that you were conscious (Glasgow Coma Scale/core was 15). We also noticed pus formation, fistula with purulent discharge on your scalp, scalp peeling, face swelling, and poor eating. Our laboratory findings exhibited severe neutropenia with white blood cells at 2.39 × 109/l, neutrophils at 0.25 × 109/l, and lymphocytes at 2.1 × 109/l.
Patient: Oh, that sounds bad.
Doctor: Yes, we also found increased acute-phase reactants like erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 101 mm/hour and C-reactive protein at 272 mg/dl. Your pus culture exhibited Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, your blood culture and urine culture were negative.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: Your chest X-ray and urinalysis results came back normal, as well as your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. We also checked your serum titers of IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE and percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which were normal.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: We conducted tests for HIV, HBV, HCV, EBV, and CMV, and all of them came back negative. We also performed a bone marrow analysis, which revealed a maturation arrest at the promyelocyte/myelocyte stage with few mature neutrophils. There was no evidence of malignant involvement in the bone marrow.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: We did a computed tomography (CT) scan of your head and skull, which showed subcutaneous emphysema of the scalp, but neither brain injury nor skull fractures were found.
Patient: Good to know.
Doctor: Based on all these findings, we diagnosed you with necrotizing fasciitis of the scalp and septicaemia. We treated you with pentaglobin (0.5 g/kg) and a combination of three antibiotics: vancomycin, meropenem, and metronidazole.

"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me how you injured your finger?
Patient: Hi, I was feeding my horse, and while I was stroking its hair, the animal chewed the fourth finger of my left hand. It was very painful and I couldn't move my finger at all.
Doctor: I see. Were both you and the horse up to date on your required vaccinations?
Patient: Yes, we both had all the necessary vaccinations.
Doctor: Okay, good to know. When you arrived at the emergency department, you were conscious, in good general condition, and apyretic, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Our examination revealed a crush injury of your fourth finger with tendons and bone exposed. We performed copious irrigation with normal saline (2 liters) at the injury site, and injected 0.5 ml tetanus toxoid and 500 IU of human tetanus immunoglobulin. We also administered postexposure rabies prophylaxis (rabies immune globulin human 20 IU/kg) with the first-dose rabies vaccine into the depth of the wound and around it. The remaining rabies immune globulin was injected into your deltoid muscle. Additionally, we treated you with prophylactic antibiotic therapy, which included intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate, gentamicin, and metronidazole.
Patient: Oh, I see. Thank you for taking care of me.
Doctor: You're welcome. After this initial treatment, we performed radiography, which showed a fracture dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint of your fourth finger with a third fragment. This prompted us to proceed with surgery.
Patient: Oh, okay. What happened during the surgery?
Doctor: During the surgical exploration under locoregional anesthesia, we found that the ulnar digital pedicle was sectioned and thrombosed while the radial digital pedicle was intact. The flexor and extensor tendons were sectioned and shredded, and the skin was irreparably shredded. So, we performed several surgical procedures, including removal of foreign bodies, excisional debridement of devitalized tissue, and collection of bacteriological samples. We also performed copious irrigation with saline serum (3 liters), tendon striping, and finger amputation with coverage of the bone by the radial digital flap using separate stitches.
Patient: Oh, that sounds intense. What happens next?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor you carefully with clinical and biological assessments. One day postoperatively, we found that you were apyretic which is a good sign.
Patient: I'm glad to hear that. Thanks for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: You're welcome. We will keep a close eye on your recovery, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.","S: The patient reports a crush injury to the fourth finger of the left hand caused by a horse bite.

"Doctor: Hello! I understand that your neutered female Briard dog has been experiencing some breathing difficulties lately. Can you tell me more about her symptoms?
Patient: Yes, she's been having this inspiratory dyspnoea and an audible inspiratory wheeze, especially during exercise and after eating. It's been worsening over the past 3 months. But there's no cough or nasal discharge.
Doctor: I see. So, she's experiencing increased inspiratory sounds during tracheal and laryngeal auscultation, even at rest, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. And the symptoms get more severe under stress.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. I've had a look at her serum biochemistry, and it shows raised alkaline phosphatase activity at 144 μ/L, while the reference interval is < 95. Other values are within the normal range.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We've also taken radiographs of your dog's cervical and thoracic areas, including right and left lateral and dorsoventral projections. In the left lateral cervical radiograph, we identified a soft tissue opaque, crescent-shaped mass at the level of the 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae. The mass measures 14 mm × 32 mm, and the tracheal diameter is reduced at that site. However, the mass was not visible in the dorsoventral projection.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Additionally, the cervical and thoracic parts of the esophagus were markedly dilated and air-filled, most likely due to dyspnea. The thoracic radiographs were otherwise unremarkable.
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: We performed a tracheoscopy and bronchoscopy under light anaesthesia using butorphanol and propofol, with a 4.9-mm flexible endoscope. We detected an approximately 3 cm long intraluminal mass originating from the dorsal membrane of the trachea, about 11-12 cm from the larynx. The base of the mass seems to extend slightly to the left side of the dorsal membrane.
Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We also performed a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the mass using an endoscopic needle. We'll analyze the sample and determine the best course of action for treatment. We'll keep you updated on the results and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss further steps.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and hope we can figure out a solution for my dog.","S: The patient, a neutered female Briard dog, presents with inspiratory dyspnea and an audible inspiratory wheeze that worsens during exercise and after eating, persisting for the past 3 months.

O: Physical examination reveals increased inspiratory sounds during tracheal and laryngeal auscultation. Serum biochemistry shows elevated alkaline phosphatase activity at 144 μ/L (reference interval < 95 μ/L). Radiographic examination of the cervical and thoracic areas identifies a soft tissue opaque, crescent-shaped mass at the level of the 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae, measuring 14 mm × 32 mm, with associated tracheal narrowing. The cervical and thoracic esophagus appears markedly dilated and air-filled. Tracheoscopy and bronchoscopy reveal a 3 cm long intraluminal mass originating from the dorsal membrane of the trachea. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the mass has been performed for further analysis.
A: The primary diagnosis is a tracheal mass causing obstructive respiratory symptoms, with differential diagnoses including benign or malignant neoplasia. The elevated alkaline phosphatase may suggest systemic involvement or stress response.
P: Pending the histopathological results of the FNA, the management plan includes monitoring and supportive care.

"Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. Can you tell me what brought you to the emergency department today?
Patient: Hi, I was hit by a car while watching a car race and I'm feeling pain in my abdomen.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll need to get you admitted to the emergency department immediately to assess your condition. Let's start by getting you intubated to help with your breathing and stabilize your condition.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: Your blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg and your pulse rate is 88/min, so you're haemodynamically stable. We'll need to perform some laboratory tests and a CT scan to further evaluate your injuries.
Patient: Alright, go ahead.
Doctor: The computed tomographic scan of your thorax and abdomen showed bilateral pleural effusions with rib fractures, a large haemoperitoneum associated with a traumatic rupture of the spleen with multiple injuries, and a 7-cm mass at the left side of the retroperitoneal space.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is. We have inserted a thoracic drain on the left side of your thorax, and we will start non-operative management for your spleen.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
Doctor: During your hospitalization, your haemoglobin decreased from 14.4 to 8.9 g/L after four hours of conservative treatment. This, combined with the appearance of haemodynamic instability, indicates that you require surgery.
Patient: I see. What will the surgery involve?
Doctor: We will make an incision on the midline, pack and explore your abdomen. The operation will begin with the clearance of the haemoperitoneum. Your spleen has multiple longitudinal lesions in the visceral aspect, so we will need to remove it carefully to avoid further damage.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: We will proceed with the dissection and ligation of your splenic attachments, ligaments, and vessels to avoid injury or late necrosis of the gastric wall. To avoid pancreatic injuries, we will carry out the dissection in close proximity to the hilum of the spleen, where the splenic artery and veins will be identified, carefully dissected, doubly ligated and fixed with suture ligatures.
Patient: Okay, I trust you.
Doctor: After the removal of your spleen, we will obtain and confirm haemostasis through a systematic inspection of the left subphrenic area, the greater curvature of the stomach, the short gastric vessel area, and the splenic area.
Patient: Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to ensure a successful surgery and recovery.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you first came in May 2011 with diarrhea and rectal bleeding. How have you been feeling since then?
Patient: Well, I had those symptoms, and then I was put on Mesalamine 4g per day. I took it for 6 months, and my symptoms improved a lot. I was actually asymptomatic for a while, but recently the symptoms came back with some abdominal pain.
Doctor: I see. When you first came in, your physical examination and laboratory tests were within the normal range. The ileocolonoscopy showed mucosal inflammation and ulcerations over a segment of 7cm at the level of the transverse colon. Biopsies were in favor of chronic active colitis. You were treated as a colonic IBD patient.
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Now, let's discuss your recent visit in January 2015. Your physical examination and lab tests were normal again. However, the colonoscopy revealed an obstructive giant pseudopolyp at the level of the transverse colon. The biopsies showed chronic inflammation with architectural distortion and granulation tissue formation. Did you have an abdominal CT scan as well?
Patient: Yes, I did. The CT scan confirmed the presence of the giant pseudopolyp.
Doctor: That's correct. Based on all of these findings, you were diagnosed with colonic CD complicated by an obstructive giant pseudopolyp. The treatment was a segmental colonic resection. How did the surgery go?
Patient: The surgery went well, I think.
Doctor: Good to hear. The surgical pathologic report also confirmed the diagnosis of CD. It's important to continue monitoring your condition and managing it with appropriate treatment. Please make sure to attend regular follow-up appointments and report any new symptoms or concerns.

Patient: Yes, I've been experiencing left-sided facial pain, frontotemporal headaches, and diplopia for about a month now.
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've had nasal stuffiness, weight loss, and intermittent epistaxis.
Doctor: Have you been treated for any of these symptoms before?
Patient: I was treated in the past for presumed sinusitis, but I didn't get any significant relief from it.
Doctor: Okay, let's carry out a physical examination. During the examination, I noticed that you have a left eye lateral gaze paralysis. Apart from this, the rest of your physical exam shows no alterations. To further investigate your condition, I recommend a maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) scan.
*After the CT scan*
Doctor: Your CT scan results show complete opacification of the left ethmoid, sphenoid, maxillary, and frontal sinus along with osseous erosion of the cribriform plate. To get a clearer picture, I would like to perform a brain and orbits magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
*After the MRI*
Doctor: The MRI revealed a destructive sinonasal malignancy with extension into the bilateral orbits. There are inferior components seen adherent to either side of the nasal septum with intracranial extension. We also conducted an MRI soft tissue of the neck, which showed the mass destroying the hard palate of the maxilla and extending into the bilateral ethmoidal sinuses, maxillary sinuses, anterior walls of the sphenoid sinuses, and medial walls of the bilateral orbits. The mass is also deviating the medial recti medially and extending intracranially into the anterior cranial fossa through the cribriform plate.
Patient: That sounds bad. What's the next step?
Doctor: We will perform a positron emission tomography (PET) scan for further evaluation.
*After the PET scan*
Doctor: The PET scan shows bilateral involvement of ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses, with intracranial bifrontal parafalcine extension. However, there are no signs of lymph node involvement. Considering these findings, I suggest you undergo Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery to debulk the nasal mass.
*After the surgery*
Doctor: The surgery went well, and we have removed a significant portion of the nasal mass. The pathology report has been amended as moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, invasive to the bone, arising within sinonasal papilloma showing inverted and exophytic features. Based on the clinical and histopathological features, the disease has been classified as T4bM0.

Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Alright. Have you experienced any other symptoms or issues since your ALS diagnosis?
Patient: Yeah, when I was 55, I had a really hard time breathing and I felt kind of out of it after I had an enema and excreted a large amount of stool.
Doctor: I understand. It appears that you developed hypoxia and a consciousness disturbance at that time. We performed an ECG on you, which indicated an abnormal Q wave in V3 and ST elevation in V2-V3. Do you remember that?
Patient: Hmm, yes. I remember something about an ECG.
Doctor: An echocardiogram was also performed, which revealed diffuse akinesia in the apex with preserved wall motion in the basal segments. Unfortunately, you passed away the following day due to hypoxia. Your family agreed to a pathological examination of your heart. May I share the results with them?
Patient's Family: Yes, please do.
Doctor: The examination demonstrated that there was no apparent occlusion of the coronary artery. However, patchy myocardial necrosis was observed in the anterior wall of the apex and the intraventricular septum. This was accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration, mainly involving neutrophils and lymphocytes.
Patient's Family: What does that mean, exactly?
Doctor: It means that there was some damage to the heart muscle and inflammation, but the coronary artery was not blocked. Intraventricular hemorrhage was also observed.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been feeling really tired and having trouble breathing recently. I also noticed a worsening cough.
Doctor: I see. Let's start by taking a detailed look at your medical history. It seems you've been suffering from some comorbidities like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and heart disease. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Alright, we found a pulmonary nodule in your lungs, which turned out to be an adenocarcinoma. Due to your comorbidities, we decided not to perform surgery. Have you undergone any treatment for it?
Patient: Yes, I had stereotaxic radiotherapy, but it didn't seem to help much. The cancer progressed, and I developed lung metastases.
Doctor: I understand. It seems you've been receiving chemotherapy with vinorelbine and corticosteroids for COPD-related dyspnoea. How has that treatment been working for you?
Patient: My breathing has improved a bit, but my cough has been getting worse.
Doctor: To evaluate your worsening cough and dyspnoea, we performed a CT scan of the chest which showed a large amount of gas in the adipose tissue along the caecum, ascending, and transverse colon. We then extended the CT examination to your abdomen, but there were no signs of bowel wall distress or perforation. Have you experienced any abdominal pain or fever recently?
Patient: No, I haven't had any pain or fever.
Doctor: That's good. The surgical consultant suggested close observation alone, as there was no need for immediate intervention. A week later, an abdominal plain film was taken, which documented the persistence of pneumoperitoneum along the right and transverse colon. As your dyspnoea improved, we decided to gradually discontinue steroids and proceed with vinorelbine. How have you been feeling since then?
Patient: I've been feeling a bit better overall, but my cough is still bothering me.
Doctor: I'm glad to hear you're feeling better. A follow-up CT scan performed 4 months later showed improvement in your condition, with the pneumoperitoneum of minimum extent, limited to the caecum. We'll continue monitoring your situation closely and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. In the meantime, please let me know if you experience any changes in your symptoms or if you have any concerns.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and will keep you updated on any changes.
Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.","S: The patient reports feeling very tired, experiencing difficulty breathing, and a worsening cough. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, heart disease, and lung adenocarcinoma, which has progressed to lung metastases despite treatment with stereotaxic radiotherapy.
O: Recent CT scans of the chest and abdomen revealed a large amount of gas in the adipose tissue along the caecum, ascending, and transverse colon, with no signs of bowel wall distress or perforation. The patient has been treated with chemotherapy using vinorelbine and corticosteroids for COPD-related dyspnoea, which slightly improved breathing but not the cough. A follow-up CT scan showed minimal pneumoperitoneum limited to the caecum.
A: The primary diagnosis is advanced lung adenocarcinoma with lung metastases and associated COPD. The presence of pneumoperitoneum without signs of perforation or distress suggests a non-surgical approach as advised by the surgical consultant. The differential diagnosis would consider the progression of existing comorbidities and potential complications from metastases and treatments.
P: Continue monitoring the patient's lung condition and pneumoperitoneum with periodic imaging and clinical assessments. Gradually discontinue steroids while continuing vinorelbine for chemotherapy. Address the worsening cough potentially with adjustments in COPD management or additional symptomatic treatments.

"Doctor: Hello, I'd like to discuss your recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, stage III, in your right mandible. We performed a neck dissection, including mandibular and side resections. How have you been feeling since the surgery?
Patient: I've been feeling okay, I guess. My jaw has been feeling a bit tight though.
Doctor: That tightness is called trismus, and it should gradually improve after surgery. You shouldn't experience any pain around the TMJ during mandibular function. Have you noticed any issues with your bite, particularly on the left side?
Patient: Hmm, no, I haven't noticed any problems with my bite while eating.
Doctor: That's good to hear. During the surgery, we performed a VSP simulation and used CAD/CAM technology to fabricate surgical guides based on the VSP data. We then removed the affected part of your mandible and reconstructed it with a fibula free flap (FFF). The FFF was fixed in place using miniplates, with two plates per connection point.
Patient: Okay, so what does that mean for me?
Doctor: It means we were able to successfully reconstruct your mandible. The fibula was connected to the ascending ramus of your right mandible and the anterior portion was connected to the right mandibular parasymphysis. We then fixed it in place using miniplates. This should provide stability to your reconstructed jaw.
Patient: Oh, I see. So, what's next for me, doc?
Doctor: We'll need to keep a close eye on your progress during postoperative follow-up. We took panoramic radiographs 1 year and 3 months after your surgery, which showed an anterior dislocation of your right condyle. The miniplates at the connection between the fibula and the right mandibular ascending ramus had failed.
Patient: That doesn't sound good. What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that the connection between the fibular segment and the anterior mandibular region is not as stable as we'd like it to be. The interocclusal space in the right posterior region hasn't narrowed, but the right mandibular condyle has become dislocated in the anterior direction. This is likely due to a failure to maintain the connection between the fibula and the ascending ramus, leading to severe displacement.
Patient: So, what can be done about it?
Doctor: We'll need to address the issue with the miniplates. One of the plates at the bottom gonial angle area has failed, and the superior miniplate is broken. This suggests that a lack of stability may be causing stress-related fatigue fractures in the plates, leading to the displacement of the condylar segment.
Patient: What will be the next step to fix this issue?
Doctor: We'll need to schedule another surgery to replace the broken plates and restore stability to the connection between the fibula and the right mandibular ascending ramus. This should help prevent further displacement and complications.
Patient: Alright, I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me, doc.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll work together to ensure a smooth recovery and monitor your progress closely. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.","S: The patient reports feeling okay post-surgery but experiences tightness in the jaw, described as trismus.

"Doctor: Good morning, I see you've presented to the orthopedic hand clinic today. Can you tell me a bit about your medical history and the issue with your right wrist?
Patient: Good morning, Doctor. I have this small mass on my right wrist that has been extremely sensitive for about three years now. It has subjectively grown over time and the pain has worsened. I also developed hypersensitivity to light contact.
Doctor: Hmm, that sounds concerning. Is there any cold sensitivity to the mass or any specific area where the pain radiates?
Patient: No, there's no complaint of cold sensitivity. But the pain occasionally radiates down the ulnar aspect of my wrist.
Doctor: Have you experienced any trauma to this area before? I noticed from your records that you have a history of squamous cell carcinoma on the hand.
Patient: No, I haven't had any trauma to the area. Yes, I was treated for squamous cell carcinoma, but I developed a reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) after that, which delayed my recovery in the range of motion.
Doctor: Did you undergo any procedures for the RSD, like a stellate ganglion block?
Patient: I did have a stellate ganglion block, but it didn't provide any relief. I've been doing home exercises to help improve my range of motion slowly.
Doctor: That's good to know. Let's do a physical exam. I can feel a small round nodule, about 5 mm x 5 mm, with significant point tenderness. The location and exam suggest it could be a neuroma, possibly from a cutaneous nerve or the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. We'll need some imaging to confirm this.
Patient: Alright, I had plain films taken recently. They didn't show any abnormality except for diffuse osteopenia.
Doctor: That's helpful information. Given the findings, I recommend surgery to address the mass. During the operation, we'll perform a deep dissection to identify the mass and its connection to any nerves.
Patient: Okay, I trust your judgment. Let's go ahead with the surgery.
[After surgery]
Doctor: The surgery went well. We found a maroon-colored mass, about 5 mm x 5 mm, connected to a cutaneous nerve branch. The nerve and mass were excised, and we confirmed that the ulnar nerve and dorsal sensory branch were not involved with the mass.
Patient: That's great news. I'm happy to hear the surgery went well.
Doctor: At your first postoperative visit, please report any pain or discomfort you might be experiencing. We'll also discuss the histopathological review of the excised mass.
[At the postoperative visit]
Patient: I have no pain now, and I'm very satisfied with the results of the surgery!
Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. The diagnostic pathological stains were consistent with a glomus tumor. This was confirmed with strong reactivity to immunostaining of type IV collagen and smooth muscle actin. We'll continue to monitor your recovery and address any concerns you may have.

I also developed hypersensitivity to light contact.\nDoctor: Hmm, that sounds concerning. Is there any cold sensitivity to the mass or any specific area where the pain radiates?\nPatient: No, there's no complaint of cold sensitivity. But the pain occasionally radiates down the ulnar aspect of my wrist.\nDoctor: Have you experienced any trauma to this area before? I noticed from your records that you have a history of squamous cell carcinoma on the hand.\nPatient: No, I haven't had any trauma to the area. Yes, I was treated for squamous cell carcinoma, but I developed a reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) after that, which delayed my recovery in the range of motion.\nDoctor: Did you undergo any procedures for the RSD, like a stellate ganglion block?\nPatient: I did have a stellate ganglion block, but it didn't provide any relief. I've been doing home exercises to help improve my range of motion slowly.\nDoctor: That's good to know. Let's do a physical exam. I can feel a small round nodule, about 5 mm x 5 mm, with significant point tenderness. The location and exam suggest it could be a neuroma, possibly from a cutaneous nerve or the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. We'll need some imaging to confirm this.\nPatient: Alright, I had plain films taken recently. They didn't show any abnormality except for diffuse osteopenia.\nDoctor: That's helpful information. Given the findings, I recommend surgery to address the mass. During the operation, we'll perform a deep dissection to identify the mass and its connection to any nerves.\nPatient: Okay, I trust your judgment. Let's go ahead with the surgery.\n[After surgery]\nDoctor: The surgery went well. We found a maroon-colored mass, about 5 mm x 5 mm, connected to a cutaneous nerve branch. The nerve and mass were excised, and we confirmed that the ulnar nerve and dorsal sensory branch were not involved with the mass.\nPatient: That's great news. I'm happy to hear the surgery went well.\nDoctor: At your first postoperative visit, please report any pain or discomfort you might be experiencing. We'll also discuss the histopathological review of the excised mass.\n[At the postoperative visit]\nPatient: I have no pain now, and I'm very satisfied with the results of the surgery!\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that. The diagnostic pathological stains were consistent with a glomus tumor. This was confirmed with strong reactivity to immunostaining of type IV collagen and smooth muscle actin. We'll continue to monitor your recovery and address any concerns you may have.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor, for your help and expertise.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you've provided written informed consent to undergo surgery and use of your clinical data, as approved by the institutional review board of Matsue Red Cross Hospital. How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I have primary open-angle glaucoma and recently underwent implantation of an Ahmed glaucoma valve to reduce the intraocular pressure in my left eye.
Doctor: I see. How was your vision and intraocular pressure before the surgery?
Patient: Before the surgery, my best-corrected visual acuity was 1.0 in my left eye, and the IOP was 22 mmHg even with the instillation of a topical prostaglandin, β-blocker, and α2 agonist.
Doctor: Oh, I understand you had a failed EX-PRESS® shunt placed in the superonasal quadrant previously. Did everything go well with the implantation of the glaucoma valve?
Patient: Yeah, the AGV plate was placed in the superotemporal quadrant, and the tube was inserted into the anterior chamber under a partial-thickness autologous scleral flap. No complications developed during the surgery.
Doctor: That's good to hear. What kind of postoperative care did you receive?
Patient: I was prescribed Levofloxacin 1.5% and betamethasone 0.1% to apply topically four times daily for 3 weeks.
Doctor: How has your vision and intraocular pressure been since the surgery?
Patient: At the referral, my best-corrected visual acuity was 0.9 and the IOP was 20 mmHg without glaucoma medication.
Doctor: Have you been experiencing any issues or symptoms recently?
Patient: Yes, at 4 weeks postoperatively, I started to feel a foreign body sensation in my left eye.
Doctor: I see. Let me perform a slit-lamp examination to check for any abnormalities. 
[After the examination]
Doctor: I found a giant conjunctival cyst at the superotemporal quadrant (Fig. a) and dellen formation at the corneal limbus/conjunctiva adjacent to the anterior border of the giant cyst (Fig. b). Your ocular pain might be due to the giant bleb that has bulged anteriorly from the AGV plate.
Patient: Oh no, what can be done to fix this?
Doctor: We can perform surgery to reduce the bleb volume in your left eye. This will involve subconjunctival anesthesia using lidocaine 2%. 
Patient: Alright, let's go ahead with the surgery. What can I expect afterward?
Doctor: After the surgery, you should experience relief from the foreign body sensation and ocular pain in your left eye. We will monitor your progress closely.

Doctor: I see. Can you tell me when this started and if anything triggered it?
Patient: It began right after I used LVR therapy. I don't use it regularly, just when I need it for cough augmentation.
Doctor: Did you experience any other symptoms after using the LVR therapy?
Patient: Yeah, I felt a sharp, sudden central chest pain, but I thought it was just from stretching my thoracic cage.
Doctor: Okay, and how has your breathing been since then?
Patient: It's been pretty shallow and got worse over the next two nights. I've been using nocturnal NIV with my usual settings but it didn't help much.
Doctor: It's important that you came in. We'll need to run some tests, starting with a chest radiograph.
[Tests are performed]
Doctor: The chest radiograph results are in, and they show that you have a large right-sided pneumothorax. The apex of your right lung is projecting over the inferior margin of the sixth rib, but there's no mediastinal displacement.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What can we do about it?
Doctor: We will insert an ICC to help with the resolution of the pneumothorax. This should alleviate the symptoms you've been experiencing.
Patient: How long will I need to have the ICC?
Doctor: You'll be admitted to the hospital, and we'll monitor your progress. The ICC was removed on the fourth day of admission, and there was no recurrence with the resumption of NIV use.
Patient: That's a relief. What about when I get discharged? Any advice?
Doctor: Yes, once you're discharged, we advise you to cease LVR therapy to prevent any potential complications.

Patient: Yes, that's correct. I had developed erythematous skin with severe itching and flaking all over my body.
Doctor: I see. And according to your history, you had consulted a private physician for a toothache and were prescribed methampyrone 500 mg orally, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, I took a single dose of the drug and then developed a maculopapular and erythematous rash with itching, followed by bullous exfoliation of the skin.
Doctor: I also recall that you have a past medical history of hypertension and postprimary coronary intervention in 2011. You have been taking aspirin 80 mg QD, amlodipine 10 mg QD, and atorvastatin 20 mg QD, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: When we examined you back then, you were conscious and alert, but looked weak. Your hemodynamics were stable, with a respiration rate of 24x/minutes, body temperature of 37.8°C, and SpO2 of 97–99% while breathing supplementary oxygen with a nasal cannula. There were also signs of conjunctivitis and turbid corneal in your eyes, ulceration of your mouth, and swollen lips. Do you remember that?
Patient: Yes, I do.
Doctor: We also noted that you had generalized skin erythema and irregularly shaped itchy purpuric macules. Nikolsky's sign was clearly elicited, with detachment of the epidermis from lower layers when slightly rubbed, and extension of existing bullae to the clear skin indicated an active TEN. The epidermal detachment was observed over 30% of your body surface area (BSA).
Patient: Yes, it was quite awful.
Doctor: Our treatment plan for you involved replacement of fluid loss, maintaining electrolyte imbalance, and providing antibiotic therapy. We started you on methylprednisolone 125 mg TID along with cyclosporine 50 mg BID. However, after 2 days of hospitalization, your skin lesions did not show much improvement.
Patient: I remember that.
Doctor: In turn, your skin change progressions rapidly extended from 32% at hospital admission to 62% of BSA involved, with 16% in grade I and 46% in grade II hemorrhagic blisters. We used the SCORTEN score to prognosticate the risk for death from TEN, and it was three in your case.
Patient: That was a really difficult time for me and my family.
Doctor: I understand, and we did our best to help you through it. Moving forward, it's important to continue monitoring your health and follow any recommended medical advice to help prevent future issues. If you ever have concerns or questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you were admitted here due to a sudden-onset headache, nausea, and vomiting for 1 day. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I just suddenly got this terrible headache, felt nauseous, and then started vomiting.
Doctor: I understand. Do you have any medical history we should be aware of?
Patient: I have had hypertension for 10 years, but no diabetes, hyperlipidemia, autoimmune diseases, or other remarkable illnesses.
Doctor: Thank you for letting me know. When we examined you, you were alert and able to obey commands. We did notice neck stiffness during the physical examination. We ran some laboratory tests and your blood glucose, electrolytes, blood cell counts, coagulation test, and antinuclear antibody series were all within normal limits.
Patient: That's good to hear, but what did you find in the tests?
Doctor: We performed a head computed tomography (CT) and found a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) concentrated in the perimesencephalic cistern (Fig. a). We also did a CT angiography (CTA) which showed that the bilateral ICAs were absent in the skull base (Fig. b-c). The bilateral MCAs and anterior arteries were normal, but we identified an aneurysm in the PCA region (Fig. d).
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What does it mean?
Doctor: We also conducted a head digital subtraction angiography (DSA) that showed the bilateral internal maxillary arteries and ascending pharyngeal arteries were confluent with the cavernous portion of the ICAs at the skull base. The bilateral ICAs above the cavernous portion of the ICAs, the MCAs, and the anterior cerebral arteries were normal (Fig. ). The right vertebral artery (VA) was fine, while the left VA was well developed (Fig. a-b). We observed moyamoya-pattern collateral vessels in the bilateral PCAs region, the distal part of the PCA was composed of abnormally fine vessels, and an aneurysm was clearly identified in the left moyamoya-pattern collateral vessels (Fig. c-d).
Patient: So, what's the diagnosis, doctor?
Doctor: You have been diagnosed with bilateral carotid RM, moyamoya-like vessels in the PCA region, intracranial pseudoaneurysm, and SAH. 
Patient: What's the plan for managing this?
Doctor: Management of the aneurysm is difficult, so we have decided to adopt a wait and see management approach. You have been recovering well and we plan to discharge you one week after your admission.
Patient: I see, and what about follow-up?
Doctor: We will schedule a follow-up CT for you 44 days after your discharge. I'm happy to report that the follow-up CT showed complete resolution of the SAH (Fig.).

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I recently presented to a secondary healthcare center with shortness of breath and chest tightness.
Doctor: I see. Did they perform any tests to investigate your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, they did a chest X-ray which showed left pleural effusion. Then they drained the fluid and sent it to the Pathology Department for analysis.
Doctor: And what did the analysis show?
Patient: It revealed malignant cells. So, they did a CT scan of the chest and found a heterogeneous anterior mediastinal mass.
Doctor: I understand. Did they perform any further tests?
Patient: Yes, they did a chest MRI which showed a well-defined, lobulated, and heterogeneous anterior mediastinal mass measuring 15.9 × 15 × 14.5 cm. It's occupying the right hemithorax and causing compressive atelectasis of the anterior segment of the right upper lobe.
Doctor: Were there any signs of direct invasion by the mass?
Patient: No, they said there were no signs of direct invasion.
Doctor: Did they investigate any other areas besides the chest?
Patient: They did a scrotal ultrasound and found bilateral varicocele, but there was no evidence of a testicular mass.
Doctor: Alright. And did they perform any biopsies?
Patient: Yes, they did a Tru-Cut biopsy, and the examination showed features of an undifferentiated malignant tumor.
Doctor: What were the immunohistochemistry results?
Patient: The tumor cells were strongly positive for AFP, vimentin, and OCT3/4 and focally positive for CD99, CK7, and p63. They were negative for CD30, PLAP, TTF1, HCG, synaptophysin, chromogranin, WT1, and calretinin. The Ki-67 proliferation index was almost 80%.
Doctor: Based on these findings, it seems that you have a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor, also known as a yolk sac tumor. Were you referred to a tertiary healthcare center for further management?
Patient: Yes, I was. They did another chest MRI and found that the tumor size increased to 21 × 19 × 15 cm.
Doctor: What treatment did they recommend?
Patient: They gave me four courses of VIP chemotherapy and then performed a midline sternotomy with resection of the large anterior mediastinal mass.
Doctor: How are you feeling now, post-surgery?
Patient: I'm stable symptom-wise, and a chest X-ray revealed no signs of pneumothorax.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Be sure to schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor your condition and continue any recommended treatments.","S: The patient, a male, presented with initial symptoms of shortness of breath and chest tightness. He reported a history of being diagnosed with a left pleural effusion, which was drained, and subsequent tests revealed malignant cells. A CT scan and MRI confirmed a large anterior mediastinal mass, which was later identified as a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (yolk sac tumor) through biopsy and immunohistochemistry. The patient underwent VIP chemotherapy and surgical resection of the mass. He currently reports stability in symptoms post-surgery.
O: Initial chest X-ray showed left pleural effusion. CT and MRI scans identified a large anterior mediastinal mass measuring initially 15.9 × 15 × 14.5 cm, later increasing to 21 × 19 × 15 cm. Biopsy and immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of an undifferentiated malignant tumor, strongly positive for AFP, vimentin, and OCT3/4. The Ki-67 proliferation index was 80%. Post-operative chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumothorax.
A: The primary diagnosis is a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor, specifically a yolk sac tumor. The tumor was aggressive, as indicated by the rapid growth observed on sequential imaging and high Ki-67 proliferation index. Differential diagnoses initially could have included other types of mediastinal tumors or lymphomas, but these were ruled out by immunohistochemistry and biopsy results.
P: The patient has completed four courses of VIP chemotherapy and underwent a successful surgical resection of the tumor.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you've been admitted to our retina department with a complaint of decreased vision. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, my vision has been getting worse over the last few months.
Doctor: I see. We've conducted a thorough examination, and I have some results to share with you. Your visual acuity is 2/10 in the right eye and 5/10 in the left eye.
Patient: Oh, that's not good.
Doctor: We also examined your anterior segment and measured your intraocular pressure, both of which were unremarkable. However, the fundus examination revealed atrophy of the retina and choroid.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that the layers at the back of your eye are deteriorating, which is likely causing your vision problems. We also performed OCT imaging and found cystoid macular edema (CME), particularly in your right eye.
Patient: Is that related to the atrophy?
Doctor: Yes, it can be a contributing factor. We also tested your serum ornithine level, which was 570µmol/L. The reference range is 20-84µmol/L, so your level is quite elevated.
Patient: What can be done about it?
Doctor: Your parent has given permission for us to treat your right eye. We'll inject 40 mg/1cc of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) into the posterior sub-Tenon space to address the CME.
Patient: Will that help improve my vision?
Doctor: Yes, one month after the treatment, your visual acuity in the right eye increased to 4/10. The intraocular pressure measurements did not show a significant increase, which is good news.
Patient: How about my left eye?
Doctor: The fellow eye remained stable during this time period, so there hasn't been any change in your left eye's condition.
Patient: Is there anything I need to do for follow-up?
Doctor: We'll continue to monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. Make sure you come in for regular check-ups, and let us know if you notice any changes in your vision.
Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor.","S: The patient, admitted to the retina department, reports a progressive decline in vision over the past few months. The chief complaint is decreased visual acuity, with more significant impairment in the right eye.
O: Visual acuity measured at 2/10 in the right eye and 5/10 in the left eye. Anterior segment and intraocular pressure were normal. Fundus examination showed retinal and choroidal atrophy.

Patient: Yeah, I was just sitting at work when I suddenly felt this moderate epigastric pain. I slumped down in my chair and lost consciousness. The people around me caught me when I was falling from my chair.
Doctor: I see. Have you ever experienced syncope, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea, or vomiting before this incident?
Patient: No, I've never had an episode like this before.
Doctor: Alright. Are you a smoker, and do you consume alcohol?
Patient: I'm a nonsmoker, but I do have occasional alcohol intake.
Doctor: When you arrived at the emergency department, your blood pressure was 125/58 mmHg, heart rate 55 beats per minute, and you were afebrile. You also saturated 100% on room air.

Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: Due to the concern for ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI), we gave you aspirin 324 mg and took you for left heart catheterization (LHC) emergently. The LHC showed nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).
Patient: Hmm, alright.
Doctor: Your laboratory workup was remarkable for lipase of 25,304 IU/l (normal level 8–78 IU/l) and white blood count 11,800/mcl. Your liver function test, serum electrolyte level, and triglyceride level were unremarkable. Troponin was <0.01 ng/ml.

The patient reported no prior episodes of syncope, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea, or vomiting. The patient is a nonsmoker with occasional alcohol intake.
O: On arrival at the emergency department, vital signs were: blood pressure 125/58 mmHg, heart rate 55 bpm, afebrile, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. ECG showed sinus bradycardia at 53 bpm, peaked T waves, 1 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, and 2 mm ST elevation in V3. Left heart catheterization indicated nonobstructive coronary artery disease. Laboratory results highlighted a significantly elevated lipase level at 25,304 IU/l (normal 8–78 IU/l) and a white blood count of 11,800/mcl. Troponin was <0.01 ng/ml. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed acute interstitial pancreatitis with a small discrete fluid collection in the uncinate process. Abdominal ultrasound ruled out biliary etiology, showing a normal gallbladder and biliary tree. Echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction with no regional wall motion abnormalities.
A: The primary diagnosis is acute interstitial pancreatitis, likely causing the syncopal episode due to severe pain and vagal stimulation. The differential diagnosis initially included STEMI, given the ECG findings, but was ruled out by nonobstructive CAD on catheterization and very low troponin levels. The prognosis is generally favorable with appropriate management.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented to the Emergency Department for an evaluation of worsening exertional dyspnea and bilateral lower extremity edema for the past 3 months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I started to feel mild dyspnea on exertion, and it gradually got worse. Now I'm unable to climb a single flight of stairs without stopping to rest.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms such as a nonproductive cough, pleuritic chest pain, or orthopnea?
Patient: Yeah, I have had a nonproductive cough and some chest pain. I also occasionally feel short of breath while lying down.
Doctor: Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss, fevers, chills, night sweats, nausea, easy bruising, or bleeding?
Patient: I lost about 20 pounds in the last month, but I didn't have any fevers, chills, or night sweats. No nausea, easy bruising, or bleeding either.
Doctor: Alright. Have you had any recent illness or any significant exposures or risk factors for tuberculosis? 
Patient: No, I haven't had any recent illness or been exposed to anything that I know of.
Doctor: Do you have any significant past medical history, including any previous cardiac pathology, thromboembolic disease, structural heart disease, indwelling catheters, or asthma? And have you ever used intravenous drugs?
Patient: No, I don't have any of those conditions, and I've never used intravenous drugs.
Doctor: What about your family and surgical history? Anything significant?
Patient: No, nothing noteworthy there either.
Doctor: Okay, let me go over your physical exam findings. You appeared comfortable sitting in bed. Your vital signs showed a temperature of 98.1°F, mild tachycardia with 109 beats per minute, blood pressure of 107/64 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Your pulmonary examination revealed clear lungs without any abnormal sounds or retractions, but you were only able to speak in 4-5 word sentences with effortless tachypnea and no accessory muscle use. 
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: Your cardiac examination showed mild tachycardia without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There was no jugular venous distention or carotid bruits. Your extremity examination showed symmetric 2+ pitting edema to the midshin of both lower extremities. Your skin exam did not reveal any purpura, Osler nodes, Janeway lesions, splinter hemorrhages, or track marks. 
Patient: I see.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms and physical exam findings, we will need to perform further tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. In the meantime, please let me know if you experience any changes in your condition.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having some vague epigastric discomfort lately.
Doctor: I see. We'll need to run some tests to find out what's going on. We'll start with a chest computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the possibility of a pulmonary embolism.
Patient: Oh, okay.
(After obtaining the CT results)
Doctor: The CT scan identified a calcified cyst in the tail of your pancreas. Your laboratory tests showed a serum amylase level of 402 U/L and a lipase level of 553 U/L. We'll need to perform additional imaging, such as an abdominal ultrasound, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), before a surgical consultation to further characterize the pancreatic lesion.
Patient: Alright, I'll do those tests.
(After undergoing the additional imaging)
Doctor: Your imaging results are in. At the time of your visit, you were asymptomatic, without abdominal pain, back pain, steatorrhea, jaundice, weight loss, or nausea. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Your physical examination did not reveal any abnormalities. Pertinent laboratory data included a serum CA 19-9 level of 35 U/mL, HbA1c level of 6.1%, repeat amylase level of 378 U/L, and repeat lipase level of 439 U/L.
Patient: So, what does that mean?
Doctor: Your abdominal imaging revealed a 3 cm complex cystic mass in the pancreatic tail, with thickened septa, and an associated solid nodule that appeared calcified, and was associated with central scarring. These findings were suggestive of a benign serous cystadenoma. However, peripheral enhancement was observed on an MRI, raising the possibility of a mucinous cystic neoplasm as well.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: The peripancreatic edema on CT was interpreted as evidence of acute pancreatitis, further confounding the clinical picture. Endoscopic ultrasound and aspiration of the cyst were not performed because of anatomic inaccessibility related to the cyst's location near the splenic hilum, and away from the posterior wall of the stomach.
Patient: What's the next step, then?
Doctor: We're going to offer you resectional therapy based on the fact that your symptoms and serum tests reflected pancreatitis, which is attributable to the pancreatic cyst. The possibility of a mucinous neoplasm and a serum CA 19-9 level at the upper range of normal also factored into the decision.
Patient: Alright, what does that involve?
Doctor: You will undergo a laparoscopic distal procedure to remove the affected part of the pancreas. We'll closely monitor your progress and provide any necessary follow-up care.
Patient: Thank you for your help, Doctor. I appreciate it.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to ensure a successful outcome and support you throughout the process.","S: The patient reports vague epigastric discomfort. No symptoms of abdominal pain, back pain, steatorrhea, jaundice, weight loss, or nausea were noted during the consultation.

"Doctor: Welcome, I see you were admitted to our hospital after you presented with hemoptysis. Can you describe the amount of blood you coughed up?
Patient: Yeah, it was about a handful.
Doctor: I understand. It's good to know that you are a lifelong nonsmoker with no history of obstructive or restrictive lung disease, and no reported allergies. Your past medical history shows chronic myeloid leukemia on imatinib therapy. Were you aware of a previous case of mild hemoptysis 6 years prior to this presentation?
Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with ILPS back then, but my symptoms resolved and I didn't pursue any treatment.
Doctor: I see. When you arrived, you were hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg and a heart rate of 54 beats/minute. You also had mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12.0 g/dl. Your physical examination showed coarse breath sounds in the lower left lung field without dullness to percussion, suggesting no hemothorax. Your cardiac, abdominal, and neurological examinations were all normal. Your airway was patent and your oral mucosa was moist. 
Patient: Hmm, that's good to hear.
Doctor: Yes. Your laboratory work showed mild anemia, but your chemistry panel and coagulation profiles were within normal limits. Your body mass index was 20.8 kg/m2. A chest x-ray revealed left lower lobe nodular opacities. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest with contrast demonstrated left lower lobe ILPS. The aberrant vessel was traced to its origin at the descending thoracic aorta, where it measured approximately 1 cm (Fig. a, b). 
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We decided not to perform a bronchoscopy because it could induce coughing or dislodge a clot. Also, with radiographic evidence of the sequestration, another source of bleeding was not clinically suspected.
Patient: Okay, that makes sense.
Doctor: The usual treatment for your condition, PS, is resection of the sequestration. For patients with the extralobar subtype, this is completed by removal of only the sequestration. The intralobar type is managed by segmental resection or lobectomy.
Patient: So, what's the plan for me?
Doctor: You were evaluated by a cardiothoracic surgeon who noted that surgical resection would likely require a thoracotomy and lobectomy instead of just removing the sequestration.
Patient: Alright, I understand. Thanks for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your condition and prepare for the surgery.

O: Upon admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg and a heart rate of 54 beats/minute. He exhibited mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12.0 g/dl (normal range: 13.8-17.2 g/dl for men). Physical examination revealed coarse breath sounds in the lower left lung field, but no signs of hemothorax. Cardiac, abdominal, and neurological examinations were normal. Laboratory tests confirmed mild anemia, but chemistry panel and coagulation profiles were within normal limits. BMI was 20.8 kg/m2.

Can you describe the amount of blood you coughed up?\nPatient: Yeah, it was about a handful.\nDoctor: I understand. It's good to know that you are a lifelong nonsmoker with no history of obstructive or restrictive lung disease, and no reported allergies. Your past medical history shows chronic myeloid leukemia on imatinib therapy. Were you aware of a previous case of mild hemoptysis 6 years prior to this presentation?\nPatient: Yes, I was diagnosed with ILPS back then, but my symptoms resolved and I didn't pursue any treatment.\nDoctor: I see. When you arrived, you were hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg and a heart rate of 54 beats/minute. You also had mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12.0 g/dl. Your physical examination showed coarse breath sounds in the lower left lung field without dullness to percussion, suggesting no hemothorax. Your cardiac, abdominal, and neurological examinations were all normal. Your airway was patent and your oral mucosa was moist. \nPatient: Hmm, that's good to hear.\nDoctor: Yes. Your laboratory work showed mild anemia, but your chemistry panel and coagulation profiles were within normal limits. Your body mass index was 20.8 kg/m2. A chest x-ray revealed left lower lobe nodular opacities. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest with contrast demonstrated left lower lobe ILPS. The aberrant vessel was traced to its origin at the descending thoracic aorta, where it measured approximately 1 cm (Fig. a, b). \nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We decided not to perform a bronchoscopy because it could induce coughing or dislodge a clot. Also, with radiographic evidence of the sequestration, another source of bleeding was not clinically suspected.\nPatient: Okay, that makes sense.\nDoctor: The usual treatment for your condition, PS, is resection of the sequestration. For patients with the extralobar subtype, this is completed by removal of only the sequestration. The intralobar type is managed by segmental resection or lobectomy.\nPatient: So, what's the plan for me?\nDoctor: You were evaluated by a cardiothoracic surgeon who noted that surgical resection would likely require a thoracotomy and lobectomy instead of just removing the sequestration.\nPatient: Alright, I understand. Thanks for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your condition and prepare for the surgery.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you are a 55-year-old male with a 40 pack-year smoking history, hepatitis C, and a history of extensive IV drug use. What brings you to the emergency department today?
Patient: Hi Doc, I had a fall at home and landed on my side. Since then, I've been experiencing hip pain and mild shortness of breath.
Doctor: I see. We will admit you and perform a computed tomography (CT) scan to check for any issues. The initial scan revealed a small, left-sided pleural effusion. After observing you, we decided to discharge you with pain medication for your symptoms. How have you been feeling since then?
Patient: Well, Doc, I was okay for a day, but then three days later, my shortness of breath got worse. I also started feeling confused and my left-sided hip pain continued.
Doctor: During your physical examination, we noticed confusion and unequal pupils. Did you have any fevers or sweats prior to this admission?
Patient: I didn't have any fevers, but I did experience some sweats.
Doctor: Your vital signs show an oxygen saturation of 86% on room air. However, your respiratory rate and temperature are within normal limits. We conducted a non-contrast CT of your chest, and it showed a large, loculated, left-sided pleural effusion.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Your initial labs did not show leukocytosis, but we did find a mildly elevated serum lactic acid level of 2.3 mmol/L (normal: <2.0 mmol/L). Additionally, your urine screen was positive for amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and opiates.
Patient: Hmm, I see.
Doctor: Later that day, you became febrile with a temperature of 39.0 Celsius and tachypneic with 40-50 breaths per minute. We transferred you to the medical intensive care unit for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. We started you on 10-15 liters of high-flow oxygen and empirically treated you with levofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
Patient: Okay, what's next?
Doctor: We performed an ultrasound-guided thoracentesis, which revealed bloody fluid containing 20,000 white blood cells (WBC) per microliter (normal: <1,000 cells/microliter) with 95% neutrophils and a pH of 6.91.
Patient: So, what does that mean, Doc?
Doctor: These findings indicate an infection in your pleural space, which might be the cause of your worsening dyspnea and confusion. We will continue treating you with antibiotics and monitor your progress closely.
Patient: Thanks, Doc. I hope I start feeling better soon.
Doctor: We'll do our best to ensure your recovery. Please let us know if you have any further concerns or questions during your stay.","S: 55-year-old male with a history of 40 pack-year smoking, hepatitis C, and extensive IV drug use presents with worsening shortness of breath, confusion, and persistent left-sided hip pain following a fall at home.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you are the second child of your parents, and there is no family history of bone fragility or autism. Can you tell me about your birth and early life?
Patient: Yeah, when my mom was 16 weeks pregnant, they found out that I had shortened long bones through a scan. I was delivered by caesarean section at 37 weeks.
Doctor: I see. What happened after your birth?
Patient: I needed ventilation with a bag and mask. I was born with fractures of all the long bones and multiple ribs. They diagnosed me with severe OI antenatally.
Doctor: How were you treated during that time?
Patient: I was treated in the special care baby unit for three months. They fed me through a nasogastric tube, and I suffered from gastroesophageal reflux.
Doctor: Did you experience any other health issues during your early life?
Patient: Yes, I developed a right-sided inguinal hernia shortly after birth. It was surgically corrected when I was one month old. I also had fusion between the base of my skull and the top of my spinal column.
Doctor: It sounds like you've had multiple bone fractures throughout your life, including femoral fractures and fractures of your radii. Have you undergone any surgical procedures?
Patient: Yeah, I had bilateral femoral and tibial rodding procedures when I was 4 and 5 years old.
Doctor: How has your bone fragility been managed since then?
Patient: I've been receiving 3-monthly infusions of pamidronate to help with my bone fragility.
Doctor: Were there any developmental delays in your childhood?
Patient: Yes, I started talking between two and a half and three years of age and started to ""commando crawl"" at 3 years of age. I've never walked, though.
Doctor: How has your schooling been impacted by your condition?
Patient: I attended a mainstream school but started a year later than my peers.
Doctor: On examination, I noticed your short stature, blue sclerae, triangular face, and dentinogenesis imperfecta. There were also marked deformities of your long bones, resulting in a pes cavus appearance. We've done genetic testing as well. The results show that you carry a de novo pathogenic variant in COL1A1 c.2282G>A in exon 33/34. This confirms your clinical diagnosis of OI.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you had any significant exposure to leptospirosis or contact with someone who has a fever?
Patient: No, I don't think so. I work as a manual worker, but I don't remember being exposed to anything like that.
Doctor: Okay, let's check your vitals. On admission, you appear to be ill looking, febrile with a temperature of 104 F, dehydrated, and mildly dyspnoeic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Your SpO2 is 98% on air, and you have conjunctival suffusion. Your pulse rate is 124 bpm, and your blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg. Other system examinations seem to be unremarkable.
Patient: That doesn't sound too good.
Doctor: We performed an ultrasound scan of your abdomen, which showed acute renal parenchymal changes, but there was no evidence of free fluid in your abdomen. Initial investigations revealed neutrophil leukocytosis with thrombocytopenia, high C-reactive protein (360 mg/L), high blood urea (172 mg/dL), and serum creatinine (355 micromol/L), marginally elevated liver transaminases (AST > ALT), microscopic hematuria, and an ECG that showed sinus tachycardia with mild T inversions in V4-V6. Your chest X-ray appears normal.
Patient: That's a lot of information. What does it all mean?
Doctor: Based on your symptoms and test results, we believe you may have leptospirosis. We started you on intravenous cefotaxime as a treatment. Your blood pressure improved after fluid resuscitation, and you had good urine output. A 2D echocardiogram was also performed, which came back normal, but your troponin titer increased and then came down.
Patient: So, am I getting better?
Doctor: Yes, you were discharged from the ward on day 7 of your illness with complete recovery and normal full blood count, renal, and liver function tests. Your CRP and trop I titer were also coming down, and a 2D echocardiogram performed after three weeks of recovery was normal.
Patient: That's a relief! What about other tests like dengue and stuff?
Doctor: Your dengue antigen test, blood, and urine cultures were negative. The Leptospirosis qPCR test performed on day three of the illness was reported as not detected, though one out of triplicate samples.
Patient: So, everything is looking okay now?
Doctor: Yes, it seems that you have made a full recovery. Just make sure to follow up with any necessary appointments and take care of yourself. If you have any concerns or if your symptoms return, don't hesitate to contact us.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help!","S: Patient, a manual worker, presented with a 2-day history of fever, chills, rigors, arthralgia, myalgia, frontal headache, faintishness, lower back pain, loss of appetite, vomiting, and loose stool occurring 3-4 times daily.

We started you on intravenous cefotaxime as a treatment. Your blood pressure improved after fluid resuscitation, and you had good urine output. A 2D echocardiogram was also performed, which came back normal, but your troponin titer increased and then came down.\nPatient: So, am I getting better?\nDoctor: Yes, you were discharged from the ward on day 7 of your illness with complete recovery and normal full blood count, renal, and liver function tests. Your CRP and trop I titer were also coming down, and a 2D echocardiogram performed after three weeks of recovery was normal.\nPatient: That's a relief! What about other tests like dengue and stuff?\nDoctor: Your dengue antigen test, blood, and urine cultures were negative. The Leptospirosis qPCR test performed on day three of the illness was reported as not detected, though one out of triplicate samples.\nPatient: So, everything is looking okay now?\nDoctor: Yes, it seems that you have made a full recovery.

"Doctor: Hello, I wanted to discuss your recent diagnosis. During your health screening, you were diagnosed with early-stage gastric cancer. We need to admit you to our hospital for radical surgical treatment. 
Patient: Oh no, that's concerning. What did the tests show?
Doctor: Your physical examinations and blood tests revealed nothing of note, including tumor markers. We performed an Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) and found that the type 0-IIc gastric cancer is located in the posterior wall of the mid-body of your stomach (Fig. a). The histological type is poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Patient: Hmm, okay. So what's the plan for treatment?
Doctor: Based on your preoperative examinations, we planned to perform a laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D1+ lymph node dissection and Billroth-I reconstruction. The tumor invasion is at the submucosal layer without lymph node swelling. Your clinical stage according to the TNM 7th edition is cT1b N0 M0, cStage I.
Patient: Alright, I understand. How did the surgery go?
Doctor: The surgery progressed without any problems on dissection around the left gastroepiploic vessels. However, during the dissection of the infrapyloric area (Fig. a), a part of the pancreatic head showed unusual adherence to the first part of the duodenal wall (Fig. b). This made it difficult to safely separate the pancreatic head from the first part of the duodenal wall (Fig. c).
Patient: Oh, so what did you do next?
Doctor: Since we needed to dissect and mobilize the duodenal bulb as much as possible for Billroth-I anastomosis (delta-shaped anastomosis using linear staplers), we decided to change our reconstruction plan of the Billroth-I method to Roux-en-Y. To avoid causing pancreatic injury during the lymphadenectomy, we focused on tracing the dissectible layer between the pancreatic parenchyma and fatty tissues, including lymph nodes (Fig. d).
Patient: I see. Was there anything else unusual during the surgery?
Doctor: Yes, after the distal gastrectomy, we couldn't find the ligament of Treitz or jejunum on the left side, below the transverse colon. Furthermore, the right-side colon had been completely mobilized to the left-side abdomen (Fig. a).
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. What are the next steps for my treatment and recovery?
Doctor: We will closely monitor your recovery and provide appropriate postoperative care. You may need additional treatments, depending on how well you recover from the surgery. We'll keep you informed throughout the process and ensure you receive the necessary support during your recovery journey.","S: The patient was diagnosed with early-stage gastric cancer during a health screening. The chief complaint is related to the diagnosis and concerns about treatment. The patient underwent an Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) which revealed type 0-IIc gastric cancer, located in the posterior wall of the mid-body of the stomach.

The surgical team opted for a Roux-en-Y reconstruction instead. The clinical stage of the cancer is cT1b N0 M0, cStage I.
A: The primary diagnosis is early-stage poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach, specifically type 0-IIc located at the mid-body on the posterior wall. The patient underwent successful laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with a change in the surgical plan to Roux-en-Y reconstruction due to anatomical challenges. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the early stage of cancer and successful surgical intervention, although close monitoring is required.
P: The patient will be closely monitored during the postoperative period to manage recovery and detect any complications early. The surgical team will provide appropriate postoperative care and consider additional treatments based on the patient's recovery progress.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I had a motorcycle accident back in July 2016 and I was treated with open reduction and internal fixation with a locking plate and single compression screw, along with a split-thickness skin graft in Bulgaria.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the fracture pattern?
Patient: Sure, I had a proximal tibial fracture, an open fracture, and a proximal fibula fracture with a lesion of the peroneal nerve.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. When were you admitted to our hospital?
Patient: I was admitted in September 2016.
Doctor: Alright. Our initial diagnostics, including plain radiographs and a pan CT/MRI scan, revealed an onset of septic pseudarthrosis in the proximal tibia, intramedullary osteomyelitis, and a large abscess zone with contrast agent capturing 30 cm in the dorsal compartment. We also found necrotic avascular muscle areas, a loss of the anterior tibial artery, and a large anterolateral soft tissue defect covered with necrotic split-thickness graft that was transplanted onto bone and osteosynthesis material at the primary hospital in Bulgaria.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is a complicated situation. How has your mobilization been?
Patient: It has been painful due to the unstable osseous situation, so I haven't been moving around much.
Doctor: I understand. Our laboratory tests showed that your infection parameters were slightly increased, with CRP at 2.7 mg/dl and leukocytes at 6.9 G/l. We also found Acinetobacter baumannii (Carbapenem resistant) and Enterobacter cloacae complex (overexpression of AmpC-Betalactamase and fluoroquinolone resistant) in the wound smears from the anterolateral defect zone and intramedullary in the proximal tibia to the distal third of the tibial shaft.
Patient: Wow, that's a lot of information.
Doctor: Yes, it's important to understand the complete clinical course of your situation. Now, let me explain our initial surgical management plan. We will remove the osteosynthesis material and necrotic split-thickness graft, followed by aggressive extensive osseous debridement and resection of necrotic muscles of the anterior lower leg.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I'm here because I'm pregnant and have an unspecified bleeding disorder. I'm currently at 37-6/7 weeks gestational age.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any issues related to your bleeding disorder during this pregnancy or previously?
Patient: Yes, before my diagnosis, I had a history of easy bruising, gingival bleeding, heavy menstrual bleeding, and some complications after surgeries. I had hemorrhagic compartment syndrome after an ankle surgery and bleeding complications with all three of my prior deliveries.
Doctor: That sounds concerning. Were there any other complications during your prior deliveries?
Patient: Yes, I had persistent vaginal bleeding after my first two CDs and intra-abdominal hemorrhage after my third CD. I also had epidurals during those pregnancies, but I don't have the anesthetic records.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. Do you have any family history of bleeding disorders?
Patient: My family history is positive for mucocutaneous bleeding, like my mom's heavy menstrual bleeding. My maternal grandmother also died due to postpartum hemorrhage.
Doctor: I understand. Were you referred for evaluation of your bleeding disorder before this pregnancy?
Patient: Yes, I was referred for evaluation before my cervical spine surgery. They did an extensive coagulation laboratory evaluation, and everything came back normal, including complete blood count, smear, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin time, von Willebrand factor parameters, fibrinogen activity, platelet aggregation studies, platelet function assay, factor XIII level, and rotational thromboelastography.
Doctor: With all those normal results, it seems like your bleeding disorder is unspecified. The differential diagnosis could include rare congenital bleeding disorders such as undetected VWF qualitative dysfunction or undetected defects in fibrin, fibrinolysis, or platelet function.
Patient: So, what was done to prevent any complications during my cervical spine surgery?
Doctor: You received prophylactic fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate, platelets, and anti-fibrinolytic treatment as prophylaxis, which helped you achieve good hemostasis without any complications.
Patient: That's good to know. Now, what about my current pregnancy and delivery?
Doctor: Upon presentation for delivery, your laboratory values were unremarkable: hematocrit (Hct) 30%, platelets 169 × 10^3/ml. We will closely monitor you and your baby, considering your history of bleeding complications and the fetal macrosomia in this pregnancy. We may need to take similar precautions as with your cervical spine surgery to ensure a safe delivery.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and attentiveness to my condition.","S: The patient, a 37-6/7 weeks pregnant female, reports a history of an unspecified bleeding disorder characterized by easy bruising, gingival bleeding, heavy menstrual bleeding, and hemorrhagic complications post-surgery. She has experienced bleeding complications during all three prior cesarean deliveries, including persistent vaginal bleeding and intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Family history is positive for mucocutaneous bleeding. Despite extensive coagulation testing, her bleeding disorder remains unspecified.
O: Current hematocrit is 30% and platelet count is 169 × 10^3/ml, both within normal limits. Previous extensive coagulation tests including CBC, smear, aPTT, PT, TT, VWF parameters, fibrinogen activity, platelet aggregation studies, platelet function assay, factor XIII level, and ROTEM were normal. Prophylactic measures during previous surgery (FFP, cryoprecipitate, platelets, anti-fibrinolytic treatment) were successful in achieving hemostasis.
A: The primary diagnosis is an unspecified bleeding disorder with a differential diagnosis including rare congenital disorders such as undetected VWF qualitative dysfunction or defects in fibrin, fibrinolysis, or platelet function. The patient's history of bleeding complications during surgery and delivery poses significant risks for her current pregnancy.
P: Close monitoring of the patient and fetal condition will be necessary during delivery, with preparedness to administer prophylactic treatments similar to those used during her cervical spine surgery. This includes potential use of FFP, cryoprecipitate, platelets, and anti-fibrinolytic agents. Patient education regarding signs of bleeding and when to seek immediate care will be reinforced.

"Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I'll be conducting your evaluation today. Can you please tell me the main concerns you have with your child?
Parent: Hi, Doctor. Our five-month-old son has had global developmental delay since birth, and he's been experiencing remittent fever, recurrent seizures, and vomiting for the past three months.
Doctor: I see. Let's talk about the pregnancy first. Was it planned or unplanned?
Parent: The pregnancy was unplanned.
Doctor: Okay. I understand that your child had a low birth weight of 2.2 kg and symmetrical intrauterine growth retardation. Has he had any issues with weight gain since then?
Parent: Yes, he's had recurrent vomiting since he was two months old, and his weight gain has been poor.
Doctor: That must be concerning for you. Has he experienced any regression in his development, such as loss of visual fixation or social smile?
Parent: Yes, he lost his social smile, and his visual fixation has become poor as well.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Has he had any fevers, and if so, were there any negative septic screens conducted?
Parent: He's had remittent fevers for several months, but all the septic screens came back negative.
Doctor: Alright. Given the negative screens, it's possible that there may be a central cause related to irregularities in thermoregulation. Has he developed any unusual movements, such as dystonia or dyskinetic movements?
Parent: Yes, he has developed marked dystonia and dyskinetic movements lately.
Doctor: It seems like there might be involvement of the extrapyramidal nervous system. Has your elder child experienced similar issues, such as epileptic encephalopathy?
Parent: Yes, our elder child had developmental regression and epileptic encephalopathy. He passed away at 1 ½ years of age due to aspiration pneumonia while being evaluated for a neuro-metabolic disorder.
Doctor: I'm very sorry to hear that. During the clinical examination of your younger child, we found severe growth retardation and spasticity in all four limbs, with exaggerated reflexes. The Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed encephalopathy.
Parent: That sounds really concerning, Doctor.
Doctor: Yes, it is. The Brain MRI showed multiple areas of increased T2 signal intensity with diffusion restriction involving the brain stem, basal ganglia, and white matter tracts, suggesting widespread demyelination. The urine FeCl3 test came back positive for phenylketonuria.
Parent: What does that mean for our child?
Doctor: Phenylketonuria is a metabolic disorder that could explain some of your child's symptoms. Our tests also showed an elevated Phenylalanine level of 1245.71 μM, with a normal range being 25-120 μM, and a Phenylalanine/Tyrosine ratio of 21.87, where the normal range is 0.4-2.2. Additionally, his blood Neopterin levels were very low at 0.01 nmol/g Hb.
Parent: What do these results mean for our son's condition and treatment?
Doctor: The results indicate a possible metabolic disorder, which could be contributing to your child's symptoms. We'll need to discuss further tests and potential treatment options to manage his condition. It's important to closely monitor his progress and follow up with regular appointments.

"Doctor: Good morning, I've been reviewing your case and I see that you've had some risk factors associated with your lifestyle, such as marijuana and tobacco abuse. However, there's no history of alcohol excess or other illicit drug use. Can you tell me more about your smoking habits?
Patient: Yeah, I've been smoking marijuana and tobacco for quite some time now. I don't really drink alcohol or use any other drugs, though.
Doctor: I understand. Unfortunately, you recently suffered an acute thalamomesencephalic stroke which has rapidly worsened, leading you to a comatose state. Your personal medical history and familial history show no association with cardiocerebrovascular pathology or other specific risk factors. 
Patient: Oh no, that's terrible...
Doctor: Yes, it is quite concerning. On the evening before this cerebral infarction, you had a large tattoo done on your left hypochondrium and abdominal flank, and you smoked a few cigarettes with cannabis. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. I got the tattoo and smoked some joints afterward.
Doctor: The next morning, you experienced acute onset of dizziness, visual, speech, and gait disturbances. Can you describe those symptoms?
Patient: I was feeling really dizzy, had trouble seeing, speaking, and walking properly.
Doctor: You were then admitted to the emergency room with walking difficulties, disturbed balance and coordination of movements, slurred speech, diplopia, confusion, and left palpebral ptosis. Our neurological examination revealed right-sided severe ataxic hemiparesis, dysarthria, left palpebral ptosis and mydriasis, divergent strabismus, and fluctuating consciousness, with a Glasgow coma scale of 10/15.
Patient: That sounds really bad...
Doctor: Yes, it is a serious condition. We also conducted blood tests, including white blood cells count, hemoglobin, electrolytes, liver, and renal function, all of which revealed normal results. However, your urine toxicology at admission was positive for tetrahydrocannabinol. No other illicit drugs were present on the tox screen. Your Electrocardiogram (EKG) and chest X-ray findings were also normal.
Patient: I see. So, it's just the marijuana that was found in my system?
Doctor: Yes, that's correct. Clotting tests were performed as well, with antithrombin III at 108% (>80%), homocysteine at 7.5 μmol (≤ 12), lupus anticoagulant negative, antinuclear antibodies at 0.3 UM (<0.7), and C protein at 117% (70-130). These results are within the normal range.
Patient: Okay, so what did the scan show?
Doctor: An emergent computed tomography (CT) scan on the day of admission showed no gross abnormality and no evidence of cerebral hemorrhage or encephalitis. However, within a few hours, you became comatose with a Glasgow coma scale of 7/15 and were transferred to the intensive therapy unit. Fortunately, intubation and ventilation support were not necessary.
Patient: So, what's the plan now, doc?
Doctor: We will closely monitor your condition and provide appropriate medical care to manage your symptoms and support your recovery. It is crucial to address your risk factors, such as marijuana and tobacco abuse, to prevent any further complications.
Patient's Family: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help and will make sure to support our loved one during this difficult time.","S: The patient, a chronic smoker of marijuana and tobacco, reported no use of alcohol or other illicit drugs. He experienced acute onset of dizziness, visual disturbances, speech difficulties, and gait disturbances following an evening of smoking and getting a tattoo. Symptoms escalated to severe ataxic hemiparesis, dysarthria, left palpebral ptosis, mydriasis, divergent strabismus, and fluctuating consciousness, leading to a comatose state with a Glasgow coma scale of 10/15, later worsening to 7/15.
O: Neurological examination confirmed right-sided severe ataxic hemiparesis, dysarthria, left palpebral ptosis, mydriasis, divergent strabismus, and fluctuating consciousness. Blood tests including WBC count, hemoglobin, electrolytes, liver, and renal function were normal. Urine toxicology was positive for tetrahydrocannabinol; other illicit drugs were negative. Clotting tests were within normal limits. EKG and chest X-ray were normal. Initial CT scan showed no gross abnormalities or evidence of cerebral hemorrhage or encephalitis.
A: The primary diagnosis is acute thalamomesencephalic stroke, likely exacerbated by lifestyle choices, specifically marijuana and tobacco use. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of stroke not evident in imaging or initial tests. The prognosis is guarded given the rapid progression to a comatose state.
P: The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive therapy unit with supportive care to manage symptoms and support recovery.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you had an injury to your left hand about a year ago, involving a meat chopper. Can you tell me what happened?
Patient: Yeah, I'm a chef at an Indian restaurant, and I accidentally chopped my middle, ring, and little fingers on my left hand. The fingers couldn't be replanted, so they had to be amputated.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. So you had amputations of the middle and ring fingers at the level of the proximal phalanx and of the little finger at the middle phalanx. And now, six months after the injury, you've been referred to our hospital for hand reconstruction, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: I have reviewed your radiographic images which confirmed the clinical findings. Your preoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 4/10, indicating some phantom pain after the amputations, and your Quick-DASH was 81.82/100.00. Have you experienced any changes in pain or function since then?
Patient: No, it's been pretty consistent.
Doctor: We performed an examination of your foot vascularity with contrast-enhanced computed tomography and found that bilateral STT was compatible for the reconstruction of two fingers. Therefore, we can proceed with transferring your bilateral second toes to the middle and ring fingers.
Patient: Okay, what does that involve?
Doctor: First, we'll make a curved incision over the volar surface of the distal middle and ring fingers. We'll then identify and isolate the digital artery, digital nerve, and flexor digitorum profundus on the volar side to provide for inflow and reinnervation.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: Next, we'll mark the dorsalis pedis artery and superficial dorsal vein under ultrasound guidance, then create a v-shaped incision at the base of the second toe and extend it proximally. We'll perform dissections on both the dorsal and plantar sides to identify key structures like the extensor digitorum longus, flexor digitorum longus, and proper palmer digital nerves.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: We'll then disarticulate the second metatarsophalangeal joint and harvest the second toe with a long pedicle to facilitate vascular anastomosis and avoid kinking of the artery. Finally, we'll transfer the second toe to your middle and ring fingers, reconnecting the blood vessels, nerves, and tendons.
Patient: I understand. What will the recovery process be like?
Doctor: Recovery will involve some physical therapy to regain function and manage any pain. It may take several months, but we'll monitor your progress closely and make adjustments as needed.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been diagnosed with stage IIIB lung adenocarcinoma.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. According to the Union for International Cancer Control 8th edition, it's classified as T1bN3M0, with the primary tumor in your left lower lobe and multiple lymph node metastases in 2R, 4R, 7, and 10L. Can you tell me if you have any past medical history or complications?
Patient: No, I don't have any past medical issues or complications.
Doctor: That's good. I see that both your epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase status are negative, and your PD-L1 expression is 0%. Have you already received any treatment for your lung adenocarcinoma?
Patient: Yes, I've received chemotherapy as the initial treatment because CRT wasn't suitable due to the wide extent and size of the tumor. I was given four cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab.
Doctor: I understand. And after that, you were treated with pemetrexed and bevacizumab as maintenance therapy, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: It looks like your tumor decreased in size once, but then it regrew. However, the tumor size is now smaller than before the initial treatment, which makes CRT possible at this timing. We've decided to perform CRT followed by durvalumab as the next treatment for you on the cancer board.
Patient: Okay, I see.
Doctor: CRT was performed one month after your last administration of pemetrexed and bevacizumab. For the large tumor lesions, we prescribed up to 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions with involved-field radiotherapy to avoid the occurrence of adverse effects. The dose was given through parallel-opposed anteroposterior portals up to 30 Gy, and multiportal beams were used to reduce the dose in the spinal cord from 30 to 50 Gy. Weekly carboplatin (area under the curve, 2.0) and paclitaxel (40 mg/m2) were administered concomitantly.
Patient: Were there any major adverse events during CRT?
Doctor: No, there were no major adverse events observed during CRT. One month after CRT, your tumor decreased in size, and there were no new lesions or adverse effects, such as esophagitis and pneumonitis.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: Yes, it's positive progress. As a result, we started durvalumab (10 mg/m2, every 2 weeks) after confirming the absence of new lesions and adverse effects.
Patient: How long will I be on durvalumab?
Doctor: You'll receive three courses of durvalumab, which will be 2.5 months after the completion of CRT. We'll closely monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan accordingly.

"Doctor: Good morning, sir. I see here that you have no apparent past medical history. What brings you in today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I've been experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting lately.
Doctor: I see. We'll need to do a physical examination and run some tests to determine the cause. I'll start with the physical examination. *After examination* Everything seems to be normal with the physical examination. Now, let's review your lab results.
Doctor: Your lab results show that you have anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL, hematocrit at 32.2%, and lipase at 164 U/L. Your comprehensive metabolic panel is unrevealing, so we performed a CT of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast to get a better look.
Doctor: The CT scan revealed an enlarged pancreas without a focal mass, diffuse surrounding mesenteric edema, mild retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, mild mesenteric lymphadenopathy, rectal wall thickening with perirectal lymphadenopathy, left renal mass measuring 3.7 × 1.4 × 1.4 cm, right renal mass measuring 2.3 × 4.3 × 5.2 cm, marked diffuse urinary bladder wall thickening, and trace pericardial effusion. This raised concern for peritoneal carcinomatosis and/or mesenteric tumor.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We wanted to be thorough, so we invited urology and oncology services to evaluate you. They both agreed that a biopsy of the lymph node was necessary, along with urine cytology and HIV testing.
Doctor: Your urine cytology revealed atypical lymphocytes. The renal biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A bone marrow biopsy was also performed and was consistent with involvement of B-cell lymphoma.
Patient: That's scary. What about the HIV test?
Doctor: Your HTLV-I/II antibody test came back negative, but your HIV screening was positive. Your initial CD4 count was 440/μl with a percentage of 14%, and your HIV RNA viral load by PCR was 61,800 copies/mL.
Patient: Oh no. What about hepatitis?
Doctor: Your hepatitis C virus screening was negative. Your hepatitis B screening showed that you were positive for the core antibody and surface antibody, but negative for the surface antigen.
Doctor: Your lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was also above the upper limit of detection for our lab, at >2500 U/L. Cerebrospinal fluid testing showed the presence of atypical lymphocytes. Finally, the biopsy of your kidney mass revealed atypical lymphocytes positive for CD45, CD20, PAX-5, and CD10, while negative for other markers.
Patient: So, what's the plan, doctor? What do we do now?
Doctor: We'll need to consult with specialists in oncology and infectious diseases to determine the best course of action for your treatment. They will guide us on how to manage both your lymphoma and HIV. We'll also closely monitor your hepatitis B status. Rest assured, we will work together to provide you with the best care possible.","S: The patient, a male with no significant past medical history, presents with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

What about hepatitis?\nDoctor: Your hepatitis C virus screening was negative. Your hepatitis B screening showed that you were positive for the core antibody and surface antibody, but negative for the surface antigen.\nDoctor: Your lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was also above the upper limit of detection for our lab, at >2500 U/L. Cerebrospinal fluid testing showed the presence of atypical lymphocytes. Finally, the biopsy of your kidney mass revealed atypical lymphocytes positive for CD45, CD20, PAX-5, and CD10, while negative for other markers.\nPatient: So, what's the plan, doctor? What do we do now?\nDoctor: We'll need to consult with specialists in oncology and infectious diseases to determine the best course of action for your treatment. They will guide us on how to manage both your lymphoma and HIV. We'll also closely monitor your hepatitis B status. Rest assured, we will work together to provide you with the best care possible.""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'S: The patient, a male with no significant past medical history, presents with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. He reports recent concerning symptoms prompting medical evaluation.\nO: Physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory findings indicated anemia with hemoglobin at 11.6 g/dL (normal: 13.8-17.2 g/dL), hematocrit at 32.2% (normal: 40.7-50.3%), and elevated lipase at 164 U/L (normal: 0-160 U/L). Comprehensive metabolic panel was normal. CT abdomen and pelvis showed an enlarged pancreas, diffuse mesenteric edema, lymphadenopathy, bilateral renal masses, bladder wall thickening, and trace pericardial effusion. Urine cytology revealed atypical lymphocytes. Renal biopsy confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Bone marrow biopsy was consistent with B-cell lymphoma involvement. HIV screening positive with a CD4 count of 440/μl and viral load of 61,800 copies/mL. Hepatitis B core antibody positive, surface antibody positive, surface antigen negative. LDH >2500 U/L. Cerebrospinal fluid testing showed atypical lymphocytes.\nA: The primary diagnosis is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with secondary diagnoses of HIV infection and chronic hepatitis B carrier state. The imaging and lab results suggest advanced disease with systemic involvement including potential central nervous system engagement.\nP: The management plan includes referral to oncology for chemotherapy and to infectious disease for antiretroviral therapy management. Further consultations with urology due to renal masses are necessary. Regular monitoring of hepatitis B status and LDH levels will be conducted. Patient education regarding the diagnosis, treatment options, and importance of follow-up will be provided. Coordination of care among the various specialties involved is crucial for comprehensive management.'}]",Discussion on Lymphoma Diagnosis and HIV Management.
